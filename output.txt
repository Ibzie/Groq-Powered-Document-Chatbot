ABSTRACT
The emergence of advanced AI language models has opened up
new possibilities for the integration of artificial intelligence in vari-
ous domains, including tabletop role-playing games. This research
explores the potential of ChatGPT, a widely-used large language
model, as a Dungeon Master (DM) in the popular role-playing game
Dungeons & Dragons (D&D). The study aims to evaluate the narra-
tive generation capabilities, player engagement, and overall player
satisfaction when ChatGPT is employed as the DM. Data analysis
involved reviewing the recorded gameplay sessions, transcribing di-
alogue, and categorizing qualitative feedback provided by both the
new players and experienced DMs. The preliminary study demon-
strates that ChatGPT has the potential to act as a Dungeon Master
(DM) and provide a fast introduction to the experience of play-
ing Dungeons & Dragons for new players. It can quickly generate
engaging content and stimulate new players to further study and
delve into advanced gameplay rules in the future.

INTRODUCTION
Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a widely popular tabletop role-
playing game that has captivated the imaginations of players for
decades. [3] At the heart of every D&D adventure is the Dungeon
Master (DM), the individual responsible for creating and guiding
the narrative, controlling non-player characters, and facilitating the
overall gameplay experience. [1] Figure 1 showcases the ambiance
of playing D&D with the DM taking charge of the narrative. The

DM plays a vital role in immersing players into a rich and engag-
ing world where their choices and actions shape the story. With
the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural
language processing, there has been increasing interest in explor-
ing the potential of AI systems as Dungeon Masters. One such AI
system is ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art language model developed
by OpenAI. [4] ChatGPT has demonstrated impressive capabilities
in generating coherent and contextually relevant responses to user
prompts across various domains.
This research paper aims to investigate the potential and pre-
liminary assessment of ChatGPT as a Dungeon Master (DM) in
the game D&D. The study focuses on evaluating narrative gener-
ation capabilities, player engagement, and overall satisfaction of
players. In this preliminary study, a group of four inexperienced
players with no prior knowledge of D&D played the game, with
ChatGPT acting as the primary DM, assisted by a human player
who typed responses on behalf of the players and also read and
translated ChatGPT’s text to the players. The gameplay atmosphere
was recorded on video and evaluated by three experienced DM with
over 500 hours of gameplay experience, assessing narrative quality
based on criteria such as coherence and immersion. Additionally,
player engagement and adaptability in responding to unexpected
player actions were evaluated. Post-session surveys and interviews
with the players were conducted to assess satisfaction.
The findings of this study contribute to the expanding field of
AI in gaming, offering valuable insights into the application of AI
as Dungeon Masters in tabletop role-playing games. The structure
of this paper is as follows: Section 2 provides a background on
the history and fundamentals of playing D&D, including relevant
research. Section 3 presents the study methodology and assessment
process. Section 4 showcases the experimental results and analysis.
Section 5 concludes the study and summarizes the findings.

RELATED THEORIES AND WORKS
In this section, we delve into the related theories and existing works
that form the foundation of this research on exploring the potential
of ChatGPT as a DM in D&D. In the first, the history and overview
of playing D&D will be discussed briefly. The final subsection of
this section will cover the utilization of AI in tabletop gaming and
relevant research in the field.
2.1
Dungeons & Dragons and Tabletop
Role-playing Game
A tabletop role-playing game, also known as TRPG, is a type of
role-playing game that relies on storytelling to depict the actions or
situations of characters through dialogue. Players have the freedom
to choose any action for their characters based on their personality

and unique characteristics. The success or failure of these actions is
determined by the game’s rules and regulations. Within the game’s
imaginative world, players have the liberty to do anything. Every
player’s actions have consequences that affect various outcomes
within the game. Currently, there are several tabletop role-playing
games available to play, such as Dungeons & Dragons, Index Card
RPG, Blades in the Dark, and Masks. While these games generally
share similarities in gameplay, they differ in mechanics and specific
rules and regulations.
Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a fantasy tabletop role-playing
game created by Ernest Gary Gygax and David Arneson in 1974.
D&D introduced a revolutionary concept where players assume
the roles of characters within a collaborative storytelling experi-
ence. The game quickly gained a dedicated fan base and has gone
through several editions and revisions over the years, each build-
ing upon the core principles and mechanics of the original game.
Today, D&D is known for its immersive fantasy settings, rich char-
acter customization, and open-ended gameplay, allowing players
to embark on epic adventures and create unique narratives in a
world shaped by their decisions. D&D gameplay revolves around a
combination of storytelling, imagination, and tactical gameplay. A
typical game session involves a group of players led by the Dun-
geon Master (DM), who serves as the game’s narrator and referee.
The players create their characters by selecting races, classes, and
abilities, and they embark on quests and adventures in a shared
fantasy world. The gameplay unfolds through a combination of
structured rules and improvisation, with the DM describing the
environments, non-player characters, and challenges the players
encounter. The players make decisions and take actions based on
their characters’ abilities and motivations, often determined by
rolling dice to determine outcomes. Figure 2 displays various types
of dice used in playing D&D. The game’s flexibility allows for a
wide range of gameplay styles, from epic battles against mythical
creatures to intricate investigations and intricate social interactions.
The collaborative nature of the game encourages creativity, team-
work, and shared storytelling, making each D&D session a unique
and immersive experience for all involved.

Related Works
It has been almost 50 years since the creation of D&D, and although
it is a well-known subculture in gaming society, the ultimate D&D
experience is still considered gathering together on weekends, so-
cializing, and playing D&D at the same table using just pen and
paper. However, throughout the years, there have been efforts to en-
hance the D&D experience through education and the application
of various technologies. For example, computer software has been
used to assist in character and map creation, and communication
software like Discord has been utilized for remote D&D sessions dur-
ing the COVID-19 pandemic. [6] Nevertheless, the heart of creating
player engagement in D&D remains with the DM. While evaluating
the quality of a DM is highly subjective in D&D, a good DM must
possess various skills, including managerial skills, language skills,
adaptability, and flexibility. Additionally, they must have a deep
understanding of the game’s rules, memorable storylines, and even
the ability to improvise and bring their own narrative to life.
Based on the aforementioned example, the application of artifi-
cial intelligence (AI) in the realm of interactive storytelling, partic-
ularly in the context of role-playing games like D&D, has been a
subject of recent research interest. Jose Ma. Santiago et al. [5] envi-
sion the use of generative AI in transforming storytelling into an
interactive drama using dynamic and immersive narratives. They
argue that while AI advancements have augmented casual writing
and story generation, their usage poses challenges in collaborative
storytelling. The authors present scenarios where narratives are
created and character conversations are designed within an overar-
ching fantasy disposition. They also recommend design guidelines
to help create tools using generative AI in interactive storytelling.
Another study in [2] discusses the use of D&D as a challenge for
Exploring the Potential of ChatGPT as a Dungeon Master in Dungeons & Dragons tabletop game
IAIT 2023, December 06–09, 2023, Bangkok, Thailand
AI systems, specifically in the context of dialogue systems. The
researchers created a dataset of nearly 900 games, with a total of
7,000 players, 800,000 dialogue turns, 500,000 dice rolls, and 58 mil-
lion words. The data was annotated with partial state information
about the gameplay. The AI system was trained to generate the
next game turn, either as a character or as the DM. The researchers
performed a human evaluation to determine what factors make the
generated output plausible and interesting. A more recent study
in [7] proposes a new task, G4C, to study teacher-student natural
language interactions in a goal-driven and grounded environment.
The authors use D&D as the setting for this task. They decompose
and model these interactions into the DM’s intent to guide players
towards a goal, the DM’s guidance utterance to the players express-
ing this intent, and a theory-of-mind (ToM) model that anticipates
the players’ reaction to the guidance one turn into the future. They
develop a novel reinforcement learning (RL) method for training a
DM that generates guidance for players by rewarding utterances
where the intent matches the ToM-anticipated player actions. In
a similar vein, Charlene Ang et al. [1] investigated the impact of
employing AI techniques in designing a virtual dungeon master
(VDM) on the gameplay experience of D&D players. The VDM
utilized OpenAI’s GPT2 model to generate story prompts, demon-
strating the potential of AI to facilitate interactive storytelling in
role-playing games. However, the study also highlighted the limi-
tations of AI, with the VDM lacking consistency in the quality of
its generated stories. In conclusion, these studies demonstrate the
potential of AI in enhancing the creativity and flexibility of D&D
storytelling. They provide valuable insights into the use of AI for
interactive storytelling and dialogue systems, and they pave the
way for future research in this field.

METHODOLOGY
The methodology section of this research provides an overview of
the design and procedures employed to explore the potential of
using ChatGPT as a DM. This section outlines the research design,
participant selection, data collection methods and evaluation.
3.1
Research Design
In this section, the methodology for studying the capabilities of
chatGPT as a DM in D&D has been presented. The experiment
was conducted with a group of 4 novice players who had no prior
experience in playing D&D. The players were undergraduate stu-
dents in Information Technology, with an average age of 17 years
old, consisting of 2 males and 2 females. Before the experiment,
all players filled out a consent form allowing the use of their data
for the study. The experimenter explained the objectives of the
experiment, provided a brief overview of D&D gameplay, and de-
scribed the actions players could take during the game. Since all
players were Thai students and used Thai as their primary language
for communication during gameplay, a facilitator was assigned to
communicate between the players and the chatGPT DM. The facil-
itator’s role involved receiving instructions from the players and
typing English messages to interact with the chatGPT, as well as
translating and conveying responses from the chatGPT back to the
players in Thai. In situations where in-game decisions and dice
rolls were required, the players physically rolled dice according to
the game rules, and the results were inputted back to the chatGPT
to determine the success or failure of their actions. Throughout the
gameplay, the experimenter recorded video footage to capture the
atmosphere for post-experiment evaluation.
Character creation is one of the appealing aspects of D&D that
allows players to customize their own character’s background and
backstory. Typically, players have a great deal of freedom in adjust-
ing various details, including lifestyle, faith, physical characteristics,
and even personal traits of their characters. However, as these as-
pects are beyond the scope of this study, the experimental design
focused only on race, class, gender, ability scores, alignment, and
equipment details. The players were given the freedom to choose
their character’s race, class, gender, and alignment based on the
D&D 5e Player’s Handbook. They were also given the option to
either name their characters themselves or have chatGPT assist
them in naming. Determining ability scores can be challenging for
new players as they directly correspond to the character’s class and
impact their skills. To simplify the process of distributing ability
scores for the players and reduce complexity, the experimenter uti-
lized chatGPT to generate ability scores for the players’ characters.
Figure 3 showcases the character details generated by chatGPT
using the experimental process in this study.
Figure 3: The character details generated by chatGPT using
the experimental process.
For the narrative used in the gameplay, it plays a significant role
in capturing the players’ interest. In this experiment, the partici-
pants engaged in a ’one-shot’ gameplay, which is a play style that
can be completed in 1-3 sessions. The experiment and data collec-
tion were divided into four sessions, each lasting approximately 3-4
hours (with no more than one session per day). The narrative for
the gameplay was generated by chatGPT, using a prompt specif-
ically designed for the ’one-shot’ play style, catering to a group
of 4-5 players at levels 1-4. To ensure thematic diversity, the ex-
perimenter included specific keywords in the narrative generation

prompt. The titles and keywords used for generating the narratives
are presented in Table 1. In this experiment, chatGPT version 3.5
was utilized through a web browser to perform the role of the DM.
The players were granted permission to eat snacks, drink water,
use the restroom, or use their phones during gameplay, similar to
regular D&D sessions. At the end of each session, the players were
required to complete a questionnaire to provide feedback and rate
their experience in playing the game.
3.2
Evaluation
In the evaluation process, the quality factors used to assess chat-
GPT’s performance as a DM consist of four factors: Narrative Gener-
ation abilities, which are further divided into Narrative Coherence
and Narrative Immersion; Player Engagement capabilities; Adapt-
ability; and Player Satisfaction. The evaluation of each factor will
be conducted through both qualitative assessments, such as inter-
views and feedback collection, and quantitative assessments using a
5-point Likert scale. The evaluation of Narrative Generation, Player
Engagement, and Adaptability will be performed by experienced
DMs with over 500 hours of D&D gameplay, specifically three indi-
viduals who will review recorded video clips from the experiments.
Player Satisfaction will be assessed through post-game interviews
and questionnaires. The results of the experiments in various as-
pects will be described in the next section.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The results and discussion section presents the findings and anal-
ysis of the research exploring the potential of using ChatGPT as
a Dungeon Master in D&D. This section provides a comprehen-
sive examination of the data collected, including the evaluations of
narrative generation, player engagement, adaptability and player
satisfaction.
4.1
The Evaluation Results from Human DMs
The evaluation results from all three DMs show a considerable level
of agreement as shown in Table 2.
• Narrative Coherence: The average score for Narrative Co-
herence is 4.34, indicating that the expert DMs generally
found the narratives generated by ChatGPT to be coherent.
DM1 and DM2 both rated the coherence highly with scores
of 4, while DM3 rated it even higher with a score of 5. This
suggests that ChatGPT was successful in producing narra-
tives that were logically consistent and exhibited a clear
narrative structure.
• Narrative Immersion: The average score for Narrative Im-
mersion is 2.67, indicating a relatively lower level of immer-
sion. DM1 rated the immersion the lowest with a score of
2, while DM2 and DM3 both provided scores of 3. This sug-
gests that while the narratives may have been coherent, they
may have lacked the depth and immersive qualities neces-
sary to fully engage the players and transport them into
the game world. However, the post-evaluation interviews
with the three DMs indicated that the experimental setup
might have had an impact on the measurement of narrative
immersion. This is because a human facilitator was involved
in translating the communication between the players and
chatGPT, potentially affecting the use of vocabulary, facial
expressions, or gestures that could influence the players’ nar-
rative immersion. The researchers believe that the language
differences, cultural factors, and language proficiency might
have affected narrative immersion and may not accurately
reflect the true potential of chatGPT in this aspect.
• Player Engagement: The average score for Player Engage-
ment is 3.67, indicating a moderate level of engagement.
Both DM1 and DM2 rated the player engagement consis-
tently with scores of 4, while DM3 provided a slightly lower
score of 3. This suggests that ChatGPT was successful in
maintaining a reasonable level of engagement, capturing the
interest of the players and keeping them actively involved in
the game. This is consistent with the feedback from all three
DMs that the players had relatively low engagement in the
initial sessions of the experiment, which could be attributed
to their lack of experience in playing the game. However, as
the number of gameplay hours increased in the later sessions
of the experiment, the players demonstrated a noticeable
increase in engagement.
• Adaptability: The average score for Adaptability is 4.34,
indicating a high level of adaptability in ChatGPT’s perfor-
mance as a DM. Both DM1 and DM3 provided scores of 4,
while DM2 rated it the highest with a score of 5. This in-
dicates that ChatGPT demonstrated the ability to adapt to
various player actions and make appropriate adjustments to
the narrative, enhancing the overall gameplay experience.
The evaluation results in this aspect align with the interviews
conducted with all three DMs, indicating that chatGPT per-
forms well in terms of its ability to adapt quickly, which is
a crucial attribute for being a DM in D&D. In one instance
during the fourth session of gameplay, a player initiated a
combat encounter by shouting the opening lyrics of the song
’Circle of Life’ from the animated film The Lion King. The
chatGPT understood the request, responded with the song
lyrics in the Zulu language, and even delivered a humor-
ous punchline accurately. Additionally, there were instances
Exploring the Potential of ChatGPT as a Dungeon Master in Dungeons & Dragons tabletop game
IAIT 2023, December 06–09, 2023, Bangkok, Thailand
where players performed unexpected actions such as robbing
NPCs or deviating from the main storyline, and chatGPT was
able to generate side quests to accommodate and support
these actions effectively.
4.2
The Evaluation Results from Player
The evaluation of player satisfaction results from all four players
are shown in Table 3. Based on the table each player is assigned a
number (Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4) to represent their
feedback. They provided individual scores indicating their satis-
faction levels on a 5-point Likert scale. The average satisfaction
score is calculated based on the scores from the four players. The
average satisfaction score, calculated as 4.05, indicates a generally
positive level of satisfaction among the four players. The majority
of players initially felt uncertain and hesitant during the early ses-
sions, but as they continued playing, they gained more confidence.
Players expressed their admiration and mentioned that they had
never imagined chatGPT could be used to play games in this man-
ner. All players felt inspired and expressed a greater desire to play
D&D. They even inquired about other opportunities to play D&D,
as they wanted to practice and explore further. Additionally, play-
ers requested improvements in the communication process with
chatGPT, particularly when dealing with complex actions. They
found that it took a considerable amount of time to type out and
describe their intended actions. Players also highlighted the impor-
tance of the facilitator who communicated with chatGPT, as they
played a significant role in creating a sense of immersion during
the gameplay, whether through tone of voice or facial expressions.
Overall, all players confirmed that they had enjoyed playing D&D
with chatGPT and expressed their desire to continue playing D&D
in the future. They found the experience enjoyable and engaging,
and they expressed their excitement to explore more possibilities
with chatGPT as the DM
5
CONCLUSION
This research aimed to explore the potential of using ChatGPT
as a Dungeon Master (DM) in Dungeons & Dragons, focusing on
narrative generation, player engagement, adaptability and player
satisfaction.The finding provide valuable insights into the implica-
tions of AI-driven DMing and highlight avenues for future research
and development. The evaluation results demonstrated strong per-
formance in narrative coherence, with expert DMs consistently
rating the AI-generated narratives as coherent. However, there was
room for improvement in terms of experimental conduct for narra-
tive immersion criteria, as the average score not fully reflecting the
true potential of chatGPT in creating narrative immersion, further
improvements are needed to accurately evaluate its capabilities in
this aspect. Player engagement was moderately rated, indicating
that ChatGPT succeeded in maintaining a reasonable level of player
interest and involvement. The adaptability of ChatGPT as a DM re-
ceived high scores, indicating its ability to adjust the narrative based
on player actions. These findings suggest that AI-driven DMing has
the potential to provide personalized and dynamic gameplay ex-
periences tailored to individual player choices. The average player
satisfaction score indicated a generally positive level of satisfaction
among the participants. The interview conclusions highlighted as-
pects such as immersive storytelling, interactive decision-making,
and gameplay mechanics as major strengths. Recommendations
for improving the user experience include enhancing the interface
of chatGPT to be more tailored for playing D&D and refining the
methods of inputting data or communicating with chatGPT, espe-
cially in cases where players have language and cultural differences
from English-speaking users.
This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge
on AI-driven DMing and opens avenues for future exploration. It
has opened up many new avenues for research, such as developing
specialized large language models for playing tabletop role-playing
games, tackling language and cultural challenges to create immer-
sive narratives, or even exploring interactive formats with AI-driven
DMs for gameplay. This study has demonstrated that chatGPT, even
in its standard form used in everyday life, possesses sufficient capa-
bilities to serve as a DM impressively. However, the author believes
that chatGPT still cannot fully replace human DMs, but it can be
a valuable tool for presenting or guiding new players in various
tabletop role-playing games. Additionally, it can be a powerful tool
for DMs, helping them control gameplay more smoothly as well.
Continued research and development in this area hold the potential
to revolutionize the way we engage with and experience Dungeons
& Dragons and other tabletop role-playing games.

ADVISOR: Matt Anderson and TJ Schlueter
Dungeons and Dragons is a game where a player, the Game Master / Game Manager (GM), creates
content for a set of other players. It is challenging for GMs to predict the difficulty of potential combat
encounters. To aid GMs in balancing combat, we create a simulation environment where virtual agents
automatically play-test potential encounters and predict difficulty. We implement several agents to sim-
ulate human players that fall into two main categories: rule-based agents that follow a pre-made set of
rules and general game-playing agents that explore many potential moves. In simple scenarios, rule-based
agents win at a higher rate than general agents, but with complex scenarios, the rule-based and general
agents perform similarly. These agents interact in a simulated game environment to play-test potential
combat encounters. Our results demonstrate that this simulation outputs similar predictions to from base
predictions given from the rule-set of DnD. However, in some situations where our simulation deviated
from pre-existing predictions, the predictions from experience GMs align more closely with our simulation
than existing systems.

Introduction
We develop an automated tool to assist in the game design of the tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG)
Dungeons and Dragons (DnD)[4]. Specifically, we create an automated play-testing system to provide game
metrics to estimate challenge of a game. TTRPGs are an interesting test case for this type of tool for three
reasons. First, they often have complex and interconnected mechanics that can make predicting outcomes
difficult. The second reason is how the role of the Game Master or Game Manager (GM), a player designated
with the role of both designing and running games for the other players, impacts the ability to make game
content. Unless the GM is running a pre-made module, game material is specific to a table and does not
benefit from play-testing prior to the game being played. The last reason is that novice game masters can
lack the fundamental understanding of the rule set making it difficult to produce quality content.
Automatic play-testing has the potential to provide more opportunities for GMs in TTRPGs. A part
of what makes TTRPGs unique is that much of the story and game content is created the GM, not by the
company that designs the game rules. However, the significant effort and knowledge needed by the GM
to create game content for their table can often discourage new players from taking on the role of GM.
This research hopes to lighten the burden on GMs by providing more robust tools for testing and analyzing
potential game content. Automated tools to help GMs can encourage more people to participate in TTRPGs.
This is especially important for populations, such as women, that have been historically excluded from
1
gaming.
In this project, we use the game Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition ( DnD, for brevity) [4] as a test case
for how automatic play-testing can benefit TTRPGs. In DnD, an encounter consists of a set of monsters with
pre-defined attributes that are controlled by the GM and a set of player characters (PCs) with a similar set
of attributes that work together to defeat the monsters (see Figure 1). While the official rule books of DnD
outline a method to predict challenge of encounters, this method is extremely limited in scope. The goal of
our research is to create a proof of concept that predicts challenge of DnD combat encounters.
Our system takes in a potential DnD encounter and simulates games using virtual agents. Then out-
comes of the game, such as damage taken or percentage of games where players won, are presented to a
GM. We look at both the accuracy of this system, and the usefulness of this system to existing GMs. The ac-
curacy of this system is defined as how close simulated game outcomes correspond to real game outcomes,
specifically in regards to game difficulty. In lieu of human play-testing, we use predictions from experi-
enced GMs to estimate this. Usefulness is measured both by how much there is a need for this system,
and how much this system would improve DnD games. These concerns are summarized by two research
questions:
1. How accurately can automated play-testing systems predict difficulty of DnD combat encounters?
2. How useful are automated tools for testing game balance in DnD to GMs?
Section 3 outlines how DnD encounters are represented in our simulation environment. An encounter
describes a set of monsters that fight a set of PCs, called the Party. Creatures compete in turn based combat
until one team is completely incapacitate. Our proof of concept simulation represents a sample of the rule-
set for combat, with an emphasis on early game combat.
In Section 4 we discuss the different virtual agents we create to make decisions for the creatures in
the simulated environment. We test both rule-based agents and general agents. Rule-based agents use
a small, predefined rule-set to make decisions. General agents use heuristics and future simulation to
estimate which turn is best for the team. In Section 5, we discuss the methods and results for testing how
accurate our simulation environment is. We compare our simulation results to both the official guidelines
and human graders experienced in DnD. In Section 6, we discuss the methods and results for testing how
useful a tool to predict difficulty of encounters would be useful to GMs. We do this through a survey of
current GMs of the game.

Background and Related Work
Previous work in game studies and computer science has studied how to measure game quality across a
variety of games. One way game qualities can be estimated, is through automatic play-testing, which has
been shown to be successful across many game types. These techniques have been applied to Role-Playing
games similar to DnD.
2.1
Measuring Game Quality
Research in game design has looked at the ways that game quality could be determined and quantified.
Liapis et al. [16] explored ways game levels, spanning a wide range of genres, can be evaluated. They
concluded the most important factors were symmetry, area control, and exploration. They demonstrated
the range of this evaluation by generating maps for both multiplayer strategy and rogue-like games. The
usefulness of such quantification has been demonstrated through the creation of new games using these
factors as a fitness function. For example, combinatorial games [3] and levels for real-time strategy games
[15] have been generated using similar metrics as a fitness function.
One important aspect of game quality is the idea of balance. Game balance describes a variety of con-
cepts, including challenge, fairness, and engagement. For single-player games, balance most often means
that the difficulty of the game is proportional to the player’s ability. A game that is too hard makes the
player frustrated, while a game that is too easy leaves the player unsatisfied. The goal of balancing in this
case is to make the game difficult enough to engage the player without discouraging them. For a mul-
tiplayer game, balance most often describes that a single play-style in the game should not consistently
outperform other strategies. A classic example of a perfectly balanced game is the game of ”Rock, Paper,
Scissors.” For every potential play-style a player could employ, there is a counter-strategy that successfully
beats it. This means that no one play-style is consistently more powerful than another over a variety of
players. Rock, Paper, Scissors provide a framework that is the basis of many multiplayer games[8]. The
goal for balancing a multiplayer game is to make differences between player outcomes a factor of player
ability and not chosen play-style of the player, and that players can choose from a variety of possible play-
styles and still be successful. Within the context of TTRPGs like DnD, which are cooperative multiplayer
games, both factors need to be considered. DnD is a multiplayer game in the sense that each player can em-
ploy different play-styles in the game. The clearest example of differing strategies is the choice of character
archetypes (species and class) 1 that lead to different play-styles for characters. For example one character
1In DnD species and class are aspects of a character that define what skills and abilities they have access to. Species has been
historically refered to as race.
3
may be a fighter and another a healer. Therefore making sure different play-styles are well-balanced and
that no race or class is uniformly more powerful than another is important. However, the players all work
together to defeat an encounter determined by the game designer, in this case a GM. It is typically desired
that an encounter balances difficulty so that the party is challenged by encounters but does not face dev-
astating consequences such as PC death. Within the context of this paper, difficulty is the main measure of
balance for an encounter.
2.2
Game Playing AI for Turn-Based Games
Game playing AI has been successful in similar problems to DnD. The General Video Game Playing Com-
petition [19] tested how different algorithms preformed when playing a variety of single-player 2D games.
There are several similarities between this competition and combat in DnD. Both DnD and the games from
this competition had turn based actions performed on a grid. Additionally, an agent playing DnD must
be a capable of making decisions for a variety of creatures, which may require different strategies based
on creature characteristics. Algorithms that were successful in this competition had to be capable of sev-
eral strategies, due to the variety of games it played. Successful agents in this competition use a variety
of strategies including variations of Monte Carlo game search, Monte Carlo tree search, and reinforcement
learning. Monte Carlo search has also been demonstrated to beat rule-based decision-making for games
such as the card game Magic the Gathering [25], which like DnD has a variety of mechanics that vary based
on an individual player.
The Nethack competition [14], demonstrated the success of general game playing strategies in a DnD
like environment. Similar to the general game-playing competition [19], this is an annual competition that
requires participants to develop AI agents that are able to perform well under a variety of situations. The
game Nethack, based in part on DnD, is a rich and challenging game. The procedurally generated content of
Nethack means that the players have to be prepared for a wide variety of possible challenges. Additionally,
there are several classes the player can choose from, which determine how the game can be played. This
means an AI agent must be able to perform well with a variety of challenges and a variety of abilities,
similar to how a DnD agent must perform. The original competition showed how reinforcement learning
and neural networks were successful techniques, however, the most recent competition [12] demonstrates
the value of symbolic AI techniques.

2.3
Automatic Play-testing
The time and resources involved in human play-testing makes it infeasible within the context of DnD en-
counters, created by an individual GM. However, automatic play-testing is a time and resource inexpensive
alternative that can provide valuable insight about a game. It has been proposed that effective game-playing
AI can be implemented when human play-testing is not feasible [11]. During the development of a game,
even in the context of a DnD combat encounter, mechanics and game content change frequently. Even small
changes can have unpredictable and large-scale impacts on gameplay. Given that general game agents do
not rely on specific game mechanics, they can be used throughout the game development cycle without
modification needed to adapt to changing game elements. Automatic play-testing has been shown to suc-
cessfully identify game quality measures in a wide variety of games including causal mobile game [21],
board games [18], card games [7], turn based rogue-likes [13], and shooting games [26].
In DnD, game content is often made for a particular set of players by the GM. This customized game
content makes every game of DnD unique and human play-testing infeasible. Additionally, the rule-set of
DnD is very complex and game outcomes are unpredictable. Automatic play-testing has been successful in
many type of game play and has a strong potential to improve game quality in DnD.
2.4
Evaluation and Game Playing AI for Role Playing Games
Automated tools for game creation and evaluation have been created for other role-playing games. Dahlskog
et al. [5] looked at how dungeons, often used in games like DnD, could be formally categorized and an-
alyzed. Defining dungeon structure can be used to generate new dungeons such as in Ashlock et al. [2],
where the distance to a goblin’s lair was used as a fitness function for creating dungeon maps. Automatic
play-testing has also been used to generate and balance encounters in role-playing games. Pfau et al. [20]
used deep player behavior modeling to create balanced enemy behavior for the multiplayer role-playing
game Aion. However, this required an expansive amount of player data, which would most likely not be
possible to collect for a table top game like DnD.

Simulation Environment
The vast amount of rules and components in DnD 5e, makes completely recreating a DnD encounter beyond
the scope of this project. Therefore we propose a simplified version of DnD, which can be used as an
estimate of a complete level 1 encounter for novice players.
In a DnD combat encounter there are three components: a set of monsters, a set of PCs, and a map. The
5
set of monsters is chosen by the GM, often by selecting them from the Monster Manual [17].These monsters
are chosen for a variety of reasons, which may include fitting a narrative or selecting on difficulty. Each PC
is chosen or created by a player in the table. Parties may coordinate PC abilities with each other, but they
may also act independently. A map describes the location where the combat occurs on. In this simulation,
a map is represented as a rectangular grid, where each creature is located on some cell.
The rule set in this simulation environment was determined by modifying the original rules of DnD
such that i.) it sufficiently approximates a true DnD combat encounter, ii.) it is simplified enough as to not
tax our computational resources. Notably, this environment only simulates low-level encounters (typically
done at the beginning of a campaign). A full list of the guiding principles used to create this rule set is listed
in Appendix B.
In our simulation environment, creatures (see Figure 2) take turns in the order determined at the start
of combat (see Figure 3). Each turn is defined by two elements: a movement and an action, executed in
that order. A movement describes a new free grid location within the range determined by the speed of
the creature. An action can be chosen from a pre-defined set of actions given to each creature. Actions
can accomplish one of two tasks: injuring opponents, or assisting allies. If a creature takes sufficient injury
or damage, they become incapacitated and our unable to take turns. Combat ends when an entire party
becomes incapacitated.
Our simulation captures a subset of the total available creatures and features of DnD. Pre-defined mon-
sters are available in the Monster Manual ([17]). Our simulation represents all 109 monsters under level 1
from the Monster Manual. However, some monsters have missing or partially implemented components
in our simulation environment. PCs are not accessible in the Monster Manual, and therefore we created 14
representatives PCs for this simulation. Spells represent a particular challenge for this simulation, as their
rule-set is highly varied. Out of the spells available in level 1, we implement 68 percent (27) of combat-
focused spells. Additionally, we include 24 special features (used by both PCs and monsters).
4
Agents
We implement several artificial agents that attempt to model how human players behave. These fall into
two general categories: rule-based agents in Section 4.1 and general game-playing agents in Section 4.2. All
agents have the goal of defeating opponents and keeping party members alive.
Section 4.3 describes the process for testing the success of agents. Overall, rule-based agents win more
games than general game playing agents. However, when choosing actions for more complex creatures
general game playing agents have win rates similar to the rule-based agents. This suggests greater com-

creature to act, Fiona, makes a movement decision, and then decided an action. Fiona’s action deals enough
damage to her opponent to defeat him, ending combat.
7
plexity within games requires the more nuanced strategies general agents can provide.
4.1
Rule Based Agents
Rule-based agents have knowledge about gameplay in DnD and can exploit that to make decisions. They
take in the current game state, and use pre-defined rules to make a decision based on that state. This has
the advantage of being fast but is not as flexible as general agents.
All rule-based agents can deconstruct it’s available turns into it’s movement and action components,
and have knowledge of how they interact. A turn is both a movement, and an action given as (m, a). While
movement is executed before the action, the agent can choose a movement and action in any order. Given
a creature c and a game state g, an agent can access the following functions:
• T(c, g): All movement and action combinations that can be made from creature c in game state g.
• M(c, g): All movement that can be made from creature c in game state g.
• A(c, g): All actions that can be made from creature c in game state g.
• A(m, c, g): All actions that can be made from creature c in game state g if movement m is executed.
• M(a, c, g): All movement that can be made from creature c in game state g where action a can be
executed following the movement.
A metric the rule-based agents rely on is the estimated damage of an action. If an action can cause
damage, the estimated damage is calculated by the average amount of damage it can cause (based on the
number and type of dice that are rolled), multiplied by the probability the action will actually cause damage
to a particular creature. If an action could effect multiple creatures, this value is multiplied by a constant
factor. For all non-damage-causing actions (for example healing) this value is 0.
Out of the five rule-based agents created for this simulation, the most successful (total amount of wins)
was the Aggressive Agent (see algorithm 1). The Aggressive Agent first chooses an action that has the
highest estimated damage. Once an action is chosen it will choose the movement that is closest to an enemy
where this action can be performed. This will only weigh actions that deal damage, so aiding actions such
as healing spells are not considered.
4.2
General Game Playing Agents
General game-playing agents do have access to the same knowledge that rule-based agents do. While game
mechanics are explicitly referenced in rule-based agents, mechanics have to be ”learned” for general-game
8
Algorithm 1: Rule based agent: Aggressive
Input: A creature C, and a game state G

playing algorithms. General agents can access the available turns it can execute, but cannot decompose a
turn into it’s movement and action components. They also do not have knowledge about damage or other
game-play aspects.
The only information they have available to them is a representation of the game state, a list of turns it
can make, a list of turns other creatures can make, and a way to create new states by applying actions. In
order to determine how well an agent performs in a state a heuristic is also given which outputs how well
a particular party is doing. We choose the score of a particular game g for creature c is equal to
Score(c, g) = (Hc/Mc) −(H¬c/M¬c)
Where Hc is the sum of the current health for team c belongs to and Mc is the sum of the max health of
the team creature c belongs to. The team ¬c is the opponent to the team creature c belongs to.
We test four strategies for general-game playing agents within this simulation. The final general agent
chosen took elements from the JinJerry algorithm described from the 2014 General-game playing competi-
tion ([19]) and Monte Carlo Game Search ([1]). These algorithms predict future game states by randomly
executing turns for each creature, as described in algorithm 2. In DnD, many possible turns are obviously
illogical, for example not making any action when multiple are available, therefore we modified concepts
from JinJerry and Monte Carlo Game Search to eliminate poor-performing actions in between rounds of
future modeling.
Our agent, the Trimming Agent (see algorithm 3), will first execute each turn on a copy of the game
state and model a future event only a couple turns in the future. It will then eliminate future models that
have low scores. It will then model the remaining turns at an increased depth. It repeats this process over
several rounds before returning the turn that has the largest average score across all models.
4.3
Testing Agents
To determine which agent should be used our tool, agents compete in a tournament. For each game, two
identical parties are created (sets of creatures), and had one agent control one party and another control the
other. Each agent played a set number of games against every other agent. However, due to time constants,

Table 2: The total wins and average time in seconds taken per turn for each agent in the PC tournament ’*’
indicates the agent is a general-game playing agent.
only a subset of agents are tested in this way. Smaller trials are consistent with the results shown here for
all agent sets.
We want to determine the success (win rate) for each agent when playing both monsters and PCs. There-
fore we conduct two tournaments. The first includes creatures sets randomly selected from all creatures in
simulation, which are predominately monsters. The second tournament includes only PCs. For both tour-
naments identical creature sets competed against each other, with behavor controlled by opposing agents.
In the tournament with both monsters and PCs, the rule-based agents had a clear advantage over general
agents (see Table 1). However, for PCs the agents were more evenly matched (see Table 2). We believe this
is due to the greater complexity of PCs compared to monsters, which meant the simplistic strategies of
rule-based agents were less successful. However, in all trials, the rule-based agents take significantly less
time to make decisions. For these reasons the aggressive agent was chosen as the behavior of simulation.

RQ1: How accurately can automated play-testing systems predict dif-
ficulty of DnD combat encounters?
Our first research question tests how accurate simulated games are at predicting of an encounter with a
particular encounter on a particular set of players. To answer this question we compare the results of
simulated games to baseline predictions and human predictors.

5.1
Difficulty Categories
We use difficulty categories as the main measure of the challenge of a encounter. As defined in the DnD
Player’s Handbook [4], there are 4 levels of difficulty for encounters: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Deadly. The
following descriptions are available in the Player’s Handbook:
Easy. An easy encounter doesn’t tax the characters’ resources or put them in serious peril. They
might lose a few hit points, but victory is pretty much guaranteed.
Medium. A medium encounter usually has one or two scary moments for the players, but the
characters should emerge victorious with no casualties. One or more of them might need to use
healing resources.
Hard. A hard encounter could go badly for the adventurers. Weaker characters might get taken
out of the fight, and there’s a slim chance that one or more characters might die.
Deadly. A deadly encounter could be lethal for one or more PCs. Survival often requires good
tactics and quick thinking, and the party risks defeat.
5.2
Methods
To test our simulation we compare a variety of prediction methods, including our simulation, for a sample
of generated encounters.
5.2.1
Generating Encounters
A sample of 63 encounters (sets of monsters) was generated, along with two parties (sets of players charac-
ters).
Out of the 63 encounters, 14 are taken from adventures written for the game. Fourty encounters were
randomly generated (algorithm 4). These encounters were generated from the difficulty predictions dis-
cussed in Section 5.2.2, such that each difficulty category had 10 encounters. This was done by first ran-
domly selecting monster challenge, testing if it makes the encounter to hard, and if it doesn’t adding a
random monster in that challenge. The remaining 12 encounters were designed to test specific hypothe-
ses. Six encounters were generated to test if 5 kobolds would be more difficult than 5 monster of similar
challenge. Six encounter were generated to test if a goblin and hobgoblin would be more difficult than
2 monsters of similar challenge. However, neither simulation results nor human grader found significant
differences in these encounters, and therefore these hypotheses were dismissed.
Additionally two sets of PCs were created.

1. Balanced Party: The balanced party has a combination of different player archtypes. This is the a
kind of party.
2. Unbalanced Party: This party contains only one type of PC (magic users). This kind of party is less
common in DnD games.
Details about the parties are in Appendix C.
5.2.2
DMG Guidelines for Estimating Difficulty
The Dungeon Master’s Guide (DMG) [10] provides a formula for determining the difficulty of an encounter
for a given party. The first step is to determine calculate a special value, called the Adjusted XP, for an
encounter. The Adjusted XP is calculated as shown in Equation 1. In this formula n represents the number
of monsters in the encounter, XPi represent the challenge value for monster i, and Mn is a static multiplier
for an encounter with n monsters. Overall this formula represents the total sum of challenge of individual
monsters, adjusted for the added challenge of fighting multiple monsters.
A = Mn(
n
X
i=0
XPi)
(1)
The adjusted XP is compared with to thresholds determined by the PCs in the party. For each party 4
thresholds can be calculated by the level of each player in the party, representing the 4 difficulty categories.
Whichever threshold is closest to the adjusted XP is the given difficulty of the encounter.
However, there are some ways this system is flawed. The constant multiplier does not take into account
emerging difficulty from how specific monsters may interact and the challenge rating does not consider
variation amongst monsters at the same level. Additionally the specific strengths or weakness of the PCs
13
are not considered. Since the two created parties have the same number and level of players, the difficulty
predictions for an encounter by the DMG is the same regardless of party.
5.2.3
Simulated Games for Estimating Difficulty
For each sample encounter, we record outcomes from simulated games using the Aggressive Agent as it
was the fastest and most effective agent. Each encounter was simulated for 40 games per party (80 times
total). Each game produced the following statistics:
• Total damage: The amount of damage PCs took in the game divided by the number of PCs.
• Normalized Damage: The amount of damage taken by PCs divided by the maximum amount of
damage they can take.
• Success rate: the number of games won by PCs divided by the number of games.
For each encounter the average and standard deviation values of these statistics from all simulated
games were recorded. Encounters are predicted to be harder if damage is high and success rate is low.
Table 3 demonstrates how to determine the difficulty based on simulated games results. This is an in-
terpretation of the difficulty categories description from the Players Handbook, discussed in Section 5.1.
Generally this was done through modeling scenarios the descriptions implied. For example a medium en-
counter might have “one or two scary moments,” which can occur is PCs get very low on health. For a 5
player party, if 4 PCs take minimal damage (10%), but one PC takes significant damage 80%), the total nor-
malized damage is 0.2. If 2 PCs take significant damage, then normalized damage is 0.4. However, these
descriptions are not precise in their language, so there is a wide margin of error for these values.
For Easy encounters, success is “nearly guaranteed” so success rate is set to 1. Additionally PCs should
use little resources, so normalized damage rates are fairly low (less then 0.2). For Medium encounter, PC
“should” be successful so success rate is set to 1 also. There can be “scary moments” most likely referring
to PCs getting to very low HP values. In a 5 player game if one player was reduced to 20% health, while
other took minimal damage the normalized damage is likely to fall between 0.2 and 0.4. In hard encounters
things “could go badly” meaning success is not guaranteed, but there is only a “slim chance” of a PCs
dying. This means success is still more likely than not. Since one or more PCs might die, damage is likely
to be higher.

Predictions from Expert GMs
In situations where simulated games produce different predictions than DMG guidelines, we ask human
graders to give their predictions.
We required participants using CloudResearch. They are first asked a series of question that tested their
experience and knowledge about DnD as a GM. The participants that passed the screenings reported have
the following qualities:
• Played DnD 5e as a player for at least 6 months.
• Played DnD 5e as a GM for at least 3 months.
• Were able to answer a basic question about the game.
After the screenings, participants answer questions about their experience in the game, dicussed in
greater detail in Section 6, before being presented with encounters to grade.
In total 4 encounters are presented to each participant. Half of the participants were presented these
encounters with the balanced party and half were presented the unbalanced party. The order of encoun-
ters are randomly shuffled for each participant. The encounters presented are the following (more details
available in Appendix D)
• Encounter 1: An encounter with adjusted XP of 250 (medium difficulty) that was predicted to be easy
by the simulation.
• Encounter 2: An encounter with adjusted XP of 250 (medium difficulty) that was predicted to be hard
by the simulation.
• Encounter 3: An encounter with adjusted XP of 400 (hard difficulty) that was predicted to be medium
difficulty by the simulation.
• Encounter 4: An encounter with adjust XP 500 (deadly difficulty) that was predicted to be a medium
difficulty by the simulation.
A completed character sheet (e.g. Figure 2) is given for each monster in the encounter. In contrast only a
sample of information is presented about the PCs in the party (Species, Class, Armor Class, and Hit Points).
15
A total of 328 participants opened the survey, of which 69 successfully completed screening measures.
Out of the 69 participants, 46 were men and 23 were women. The racial breakdown of our sample in-
cluded 44 White individuals, 15 Black individuals, 5 Asian individuals, 5 Lantinx individuals, and 1 mixed
race individual. The median age was 32, with the youngest participant being 21 and the oldest being 55.
Additionally, 58 participants identify as straight, 9 identify as bisexual, and 2 identify as gay.
5.3
Results
Simulated games produce similar predictions to the predictions given by the DMG, but there are many
instances where simulation result differ from DMG predictions. Predictions from GMs, in at least some
cases, align more with simulated predictions than with DMG predictions.
5.3.1
Simulation Outcomes
The difficulty predictions from the DMG correlate strongly with simulated game outputs. However, there
is large variation of the simulated outcomes within each difficulty category predicted by the DMG. This
variation is caused both by PC and monster composition. In the Balanced Party, PCs take significantly less
damage than the Unbalanced Party. Further, in Encounter 1 PCs took less damage than in Encounter 2,
despite both encounters being predicted to be equally challenging in the DMG.
General Results
The difficulty predictions from the DMG has a significant influence on the outcomes of simulated games
Figure 4. A one-way Anova on total damage by DMG difficulty category shows significant results (F(4, 63)=
19.52, p < 0.001). Post-hoc tests shows significant difference between all categories apart from Easy and
Medium as shown in Table 4.
Appendix F shows the simulation results broken down by adjusted XP. While this also shows a positive
correlation between DMG metrics and simulation results, it demonstrates that that there is a lot of variabil-
ity of simulated outcomes even within one adjusted XP value. These is influenced by both PC composition
and monster composition.
PC Composition
In Section 5.2.1 two parties are described: the Balanced Party and the Unbalanced Party, where the
Balanced Party is a combination of magic and non-magic users and the Unbalanced Party is all magic
users. Figure 5 shows the average damage taken for each party. Despite the DMG predicting both parties
to be equally equipped, the Balanced Party takes less damage than the Unbalanced Party across all DMG
predicted difficulties. An Independent T-test shows that the Balanced Party takes significantly less damage

for the Balanced Party than for the Unbalanced Party. These results are replicated when the general agent
is used, discussed in Section E.2.
Monster Composition
Even taking PC composition into account, our simulation predicts certain monster compositions to be
easier or harder than the DMG predicts. Four of the most divergent were sampled to be presented to human
GMs. The DMG metrics and simulation outputs are presented in Table 5.
5.3.2
Predictions of GMs
Experienced GMs are presented with 4 encounters, either played by the Balanced Party or the Unbalanced
Party. For each monster and party pair the GMs give the encounter a difficulty category (easy to deadly).

Table 6: All significant pair differences for GM difficulty predictions across encounter / party groups found
by Tukey test. All insignificant pairs were omitted
The responses are given in detail in Appendix F. For analysis these categories were given numerical values
(0-3). An Anova of these values grouped by encounter / party pairs showed significant results (F = 6.558,
p = < 0.0001). The post-hoc tests are shown in Table 6.
The most interesting point of comparison is the predictions from GMS of Encounter 1 and Encounter 2
with either the Balanced Party or the Unbalanced Party. All four monster / party categories are predicted
by the DMG to be medium difficulty with an adjusted XP of 250. However, our simulation predicts the
encounters with the Balanced Party to be lower difficulty than the Unbalanced Party, and Encounter 1 to be
lower difficulty than Encounter 2. Figure 6 shows the mean prediction value for these four groups. Similar
to simulation predictions, the GMs found Encounter 1 with the Balanced Party to be easier than Encounter
2 with the Unbalanced Party. Encounter 1 with the Balanced Party had a mean prediction value of 0.943
(medium) and Encounter 2 with the Unbalanced Party has a mean category value of 1.73 (hard).
Generally for Encounters 3 and 4, the mean category value from GM predictions can be rounded to 1
(medium). The one exception is Encounter 4 for the Balanced Party where the mean category value was 2.0
(hard). This generally aligns with the simulation predictions, and disagrees with DMG predictions.
Overall mean difference between encounter / pair groups of the GM predictions align with simulation
predictions, but not all difference were found to be statistically different. This could be due to the wide
variability of predictions from GMs. The average standard deviation of category values was 0.876 across
the 8 encounter / party pairs, which is almost a complete category difference. Even amongst experienced
GMs, there was disagreement about the difficulty of encounters. This demonstrates the complexity of the
task at hand.
5.4
Discussion
Across many encounters, the predictions from the base rule-set has an effect on outcomes of simulated
games. However, there are several situations where simulated outcomes do not match DMG predictions.
19
Figure 6: GM predictions for the 4 encounter / party pairs that were found to be medium difficulty by the
GM.
These deviations are influenced by both by the PCs and the monsters. Using a sample of these deviations,
we asked experienced GMs to make predictions. Overall GMs agreed with predictions made by simulated
games over predictions made by the DM. This demonstrates the usefulness of our simulation environment
as a proof of concept for how difficulty can be better predicted in the game DnD.

RQ2: How useful are automated tools for testing game balance in
DnD to GMs?
We survived current GMs about their experienced with DnD to determine the need and desire for tools to
evaluate combat encounters.
6.1
Methods
We survey current GMs as described in Section 5.2.4. Before participants evaluated encounters, they were
asked questions about their experience with DnD that were a combination of numeric and text based an-
swers. Table 7 provides a sample of the questions that were asked.

6.2
Results
GMs spend a significant amount of planning and gameplay dedicated to combat. GMs have a wide variety
of experience with the available tools for testing combat, with many GMs agreeing the DMG is at least
partially inaccurate. The majority of DMs would be open to using new tools to test combat.
6.2.1
Time Spent in Combat
When asked about what aspects of the game they focused on (Question 1 in Table 7), 35 (50.7%) GMs men-
tion role-playing or world-building where only 13 (18.8%) mention combat. The significance of world build-
ing is exemplified by one GM’s response.
I focus mostly on the character interaction aspect of it. The roleplaying and worldbuilding. The
combat is of course a staple, but [world-building] is much more interesting!
However, GM’s claim they spend over half of both gameplay (mean = 51.84%, std = 19.05) and planning
time (mean = 51.77%, std = 20.022) dedicated to combat (Question 2 and 3 in Table 7).
6.2.2
Accuracy of DMG Predictions
Question 4 in Table 7 asks how accurate GMs perceive the DMG guidelines for difficulty predictions. The
text responses from these questions were labeled by researchers on a 1 (not at all accurate) to 5 (extremely

responses are labeled by researchers on a scale from 1 to 5.
accurate) scale. Figure 7 shows there was a wide range of perception of the DMG’s method for predict-
ing difficulty, with around 28(40.6%) answers being positive, 25 (36.2%) answers being neutral, 16 (23.2%)
responses being negative.
The text responses gives additional insight of GMs perception of the DMG. One GM responded that it
does not ”take into account action economy,” referring to the amount and types of action creatures can use
in a turn. Several GM’s mention they only use the DMG as a baseline and “fudging things in one direction
or another,” based on their personal experience. Some GMs also mention player skill, one saying the DMG
underestimates difficulty due to their ”group’s incompetence” and another saying the DMG overestimates
difficulty as their players are “more advanced than the average player.”
6.2.3
Effect and Frequency of Unbalanced Encounters
Question 5 in Table 7 asks how often encounters are negatively impacted by balance (Figure 8). GMs say
on average 32.86% (std = 23.88) of encounters are negatively impacted by balance. 17 (24.63%) GMs say over
half of encounters are negatively effect and 2 (2.90%) GMs say over 90% of combat is negatively effected.
GMs have revealed that poorly balanced encounters can kill moral, make players board, or derail story
lines (Question 6 in Table 7).
6.3
GM Use of Automated Tools
Question 7 in Table 7 asks GMs how likely they would be to use a tool that predicted the difficulty of
combat encounters. 56 (81.15%) GMs say they would at least try it, with 25 (36.23%) GMs saying they would
be extremely likely to use it.
22
Figure 8: GM’s perception how frequently Encounters are negatively impacted by Balance
6.4
Discussion
While GMs are more likely focused on role-play and world-building, they spend a significant amount of
time planning and running combat. For many GMs the given system for predicting difficulty is not accurate,
and over 30% of encounters are negatively impacted by poor balance. Unbalanced games have the potential
to negatively impact the players and their enjoyment of the game. Additionally, GMs overwhelmingly
welcome using new systems for predicting difficulty.

Conclusion
As a proof of concept, we create a system that automatically play-tests DnD combat encounters and presents
the outcomes to the GM. Even with a sample of the total rule-set, our simulation found insight about the
game. Over many encounters, simulated games show a correlation with predictions from the official guide-
lines. However, in a sample of encounters where simulation results different from guidelines, experienced
GMs align closer to our simulation predictions than guidelines.
There is a desire from GMs for better tools for predicting accuracy of combat encounters. GMs have a
wide variety of perception of the current system of prediction, and the vast majority would use automated
tools if given the chance.
There are many limitations of this work. We use human predictions as the main source of validation of
our system. However, there is no guarantee human estimates are more accurate than other systems. Future
work can explore using human play-testing as another method of validation.
Another significant limitation is the small scope of our simulation environment. By limiting the en-
23
vironment to rule available in low-levels, there is no guarantee this would be as successful later in DnD
campaigns. Future work can look at expanding this environment. An interesting avenue to explore is other
TTRPG system beyond DnD. The same principles explored in this paper can potentially be applied to a
wide range of role-playing games.
Future work can also explore a greater variety of agent behavior. One element of difficulty that our
GMs discussed was player skill. Players with more experience are better equipped to handle encounters
that novice players may struggle with. Play-style is another factor that can greatly impact the outcomes of
games. Expanding the agents to better reflect how individual players would behave would improve the
accuracy of simulated games.
Automated systems have the potential to encourage new players to gain confidence to lead games.
Steep learning curves, complex rule-sets, and negative combat outcomes can discourage new GMs from
continuing the game. This is especially important to consider within a gaming culture that is often hostile
to women [24], people of color [9], and people in the LGBTQ+ community [22, 6] It should not be ignored
than even in our small sample, our participants are predominately straight, white men. While TTRPGs can
be a great resource for identity exploration [23], many identities have been excluded from it. Our system
provides a tool that does not rely on intuition or experience, which can lower the barrier of entry and create
better starting experience to new GMs. Our hope is can encourage populations that have been historically
excluded from gaming to become GMs and continue in the game. This can allow for a greater number of
stories to be told, from a greater pool of creators.
This research can extend beyond the area of TTRPGs. There are many similarities between the mechanics
of TTRPGs and other genres of games. It is not difficult to imagine how a tool to analyze DnD encounters
could be applied to games with similar turn-based fighting mechanics. Making seemingly minor changes to
game mechanics can have major effects on gameplay, which could require expensive and time consuming
play-testing to discover. Outside of game development, many areas could benefit from a greater diversity
of human input including science, public policy, and engineering. The vast amount of technical expertise,
however, hinders many people from contributing to these fields. By using computation to offload some of
this technical labor, people with a variety of skill sets could contribute to a wider range of endeavors.

Guiding Principles
In order to determine how to simplify a DnD encounter for this simulation we develop a series of guiding
principles. The base rule set of DnD is reduced using these principles.
• Players and monsters should select from the fewest number of choices possible.
– Justification: New players and GMs alike don’t want to be overloaded with possible actions
when they are just learning the game.
– Application: There are no bonus actions in this simulation.
• Rules and mechanics can be condensed to what would happen most of the time, even if there are
some outlier cases.
– Justification: Rules or mechanics that are infrequently used are less likely to have major impacts
on simulation results.
– Example: Opportunity attacks (a creature’s ability to attack a fleeing enemy) will occur at the
first time they could happen, as opposed to someone waiting for a better opporuntity
• Game content available to the simulation, such as special features or spells, can be limited to the most
frequent instances or categories.
27
– Justification: If a game object is not frequently used, it is less likely to have a significant effect on
a simulation result.
– Example: The petrified condition is not implemented.
• This simulation is limited to players at level 1 and monsters at challenge level 1
– Justification: This project is necessarily small in scope, and the number of rules and caveats after
level 1 grows significantly
– Example: Shapeshifting for druids is not implemented
• For mechanics that have large action spaces, where a creature has to choose from a large set of options,
the simulation can use a random sample of those spaces rather than the complete action space.
– Justification: A random sample can be used as an estimate for the power of the base mechanic.
– example: The possible movement a creature can make is reduced by a factor of 2 in this simula-
tion.
• Rules and mechanics that are not predominantly focused on combat are not considered in this simu-
lation.
– Justification: These mechanics are expected to have a small effect on the outcomes of combat.
– Example: The heart sight spell (knowing the emotions of a creature) is not implemented in this
simulation.

Supplementary Results
Apart from the major findings discussed in Section 5.3.1 and Section 5.3.2, some interesting results came
out simulations.
E.1
Standard Deviation
Apart from pure difficulty metrics, our simulation capture variability measures. From this GMs could
estimate not only the game outcomes, but the expected range of outcomes. If the standard deviation is high
for an encounter, the GM should be prepared for a wide variety of potential outcomes.
We find that both DMG predicted difficulty and party composition have an effect on the standard devia-
tion of total damage taken. The Balanced Party had smaller standard deviation values than the Unbalanced
Party, as shown in Figure 9. Similarly the standard deviation increased as DMG predicted difficulty in-
crease, as seen in Figure 10.
E.2
Simulated Games by Agent Type
We run the same encounter set with both the rule-based agent (Aggressive) and the general agent (Trim-
ming), as seen in Figure 11. We find that the trends are similar across agent types, however with the general
agent the PCs are more successful, making easier encounters. This is most likely due to the fact that the
Trimming agent did better in the tournament with just PCs then in the tournament with monsters.
We also look at difference between parties for simulations using the general agent, shown in Figure 12.
Similar to the rule-based agent, the Balanced Party takes significantly less damage the the Unbalanced Party

Bachelor Thesis, Faculty Applied Computer Sciences and Biosciences

Abstract
The aim of this bachelor thesis is to find out how the use of artificial intelligence,
specifically the one used in combat situations, can increase the playing time or even the
replay value of games in the action role-playing genre. Thereby, it focuses mainly on
combat situations between a player and an artificial intelligence.
To begin with, this bachelor thesis examines the action role-playing genre in order to
find a suitable definition for it. Accordingly, action role-playing games involve titles that
send the player on a hero’s journey-like adventure in which they must prove their skills
in combat against virtual opponents. The greatest challenge of these real-time battles
comes from the required quick reflexes, skill queries and hand-eye coordination.
Next, six means of increasing the replayability of a game are explored: Experience and
Nostalgia, Variety and Randomness, Goals and Completion, Difficulty, Learning, and
Social Aspect. The paper then proceeds to give an explanation for the term Artificial
Intelligence and examines the various methods used to create intelligent behavior as
well as the general advancement of the research field. Special attention is given to the
implementation methods of Finite State Machines and Behavior Trees, as they are the
most widely used methods for creating behavioral patterns of virtual characters.
Finally, a study conducted as part of the bachelor thesis is described, which compares a
mathematically balanced artificial intelligence with a behaviorally balanced one in terms
of game performance regarding the willingness of test subjects to purchase and play
through the game as well as its replay value. The thesis concludes with the findings
that while the behavioral approach is more promising than the mathematical approach,
a combination of the two methods ultimately leads to the best outcome. Furthermore,
the study shows that the use of artificial intelligence to individualize gaming experiences
is promising for the future of the gaming industry.

1. Introduction
In only a few decades, the games industry has evolved from small games that are played
in arcades to large productions with hundreds of developers and an average budget of
several million dollars, featuring a multitude of hours of gameplay. By now, games are
the biggest business sector in the entertainment industry. They are no longer a niche
but have reached the popular mainstream. Certainly, such a big market comes with
great competition as well. Various AAA game studios are pushing out games every year,
which makes it difficult for smaller studios and developers, especially those of the indie
sector, to be profitable and withstand in the market. High playtime and replayability are
a major factor for keeping up with the competition, which means that “[g]ames must
be designed to hold the gamers attention and draw them in for sequels and other game
titles”[FGLS11, p. 5].
This holds especially true for the role-playing genre, where players usually expect to
have a wide range of gameplay features as well as a high number of hours required to
complete the game. With an average playtime of 48 hours to complete the currently
best rated role-playing games out there [Elm19, p. 43], the pressure for indie developers
is immense. Due to the fact, that indie developer teams mainly consist of only a handful
of developers or even just a single person, simply adding more content for a single play
through is easier said than done. Luckily, adding replayability to a game can increase
its cost-to-time ratio and therefore add value and quality in the eyes of player. Even
better, replayability does not require any big and expensive features such as stunning
graphics, endless of different unit types, story elements or expensive voice acting. Instead,
replayability requires simple, compelling and addictive challenges paired with a easy to
use interface [Ada01a].
This bachelors thesis explores different techniques on how artificial intelligence can help
in increasing the longevity of a game. Thereby a special focus is set on combat situations
between a player and a virtual character within the role-playing games genre. Naturally,
the aim of the bachelor’s thesis is to explore the advancements of the research field
of artificial intelligence and the common ways of how enemy behavior is created and
1
1. Introduction
especially on how replay value can be achieved by utilizing these techniques.
The goal of this study is to find a method on how to increase the overall play and
replay value of games with simple game mechanics. However, the purpose is not to
create completely new sets of rules and ways of achieving a credible virtual character,
but to explore and examine different approaches that are currently used in video game
combat.

2. Fundamentals and Theoretical
Background
2.1. Definition of the action Role-Playing Game
Genre
Gamers around the world can already choose from a vast collection of video games with
hundreds more to be released every year. For players to be able to easily select the
best fit for their style of play, video games are sorted into categories based on shared
gameplay aspects and characteristics called video game genres [Wri20].
Most genres such as Puzzle or First Person Shooter are rather self-explanatory, while
others such as Rogue-Like demand further definition. However, finding explanations for
game genres oftentimes seems to be quite a tedious act, as the definition for the term
game itself is argued a lot, thus it is even more difficult to define the word Role-Playing
Game, especially as there are so many different forms of role-playing games in the world
and on the market, both virtual and analogue [ZD18, p. 19]. Furthermore, modern
games that are labeled with the role-playing game genre are rather a mix of different
game genres and stray from the classic perception of role-playing itself.
Definition of the term “role-playing
“
Simply said, role-playing in the classical sense can be described as a playful way of
improvisational theater. Pettersson describes it as “the art of experience, and making
a roleplaying[sic] game means creating experiences” [Pet18, p. 101]. In the case of
role-playing games, this experience comes with a vast focus on freedom and liberty of
choice for the player. The goal is to make the player form their very own experience
with their actions, as “[they] adopt a fictional identity or identities for the duration of
the game. The identity may be just the player’s proxy in the fiction of the game or
3
2. Fundamentals and Theoretical Background
a more complex creation suitable for immersion and acting. [The player] act[s] in an
environment that has a fictional context related to [their] fictional identity. [The player]
act[s] in the game; [they are] empowered to make creative decisions” [Pet18, p. 102]
which eventually leads to “the existence of quite different styles and ends of playing
[role-playing game]s – focusing e.g. on storytelling, playing a role, simulating a world,
or achieving goals and progress according to rules.” [ZD18, 19-20].
The goal of said experience is to immerse the player into the fictional world. Players
can then explore the world in all its facets through the eyes of their character, while
simultaneously shaping their character’s traits such as skills and abilities as they progress.
Comparing it to typical literature narrative, players do not take up the role of an authorial
narrator that mostly serves as an observer, but participate in the story as one of the main
characters. The game world itself serves as a playground for the players in which they
can make a change and have their impact on its systems as well as its history.
The beginning of role-playing as a game type
In the sense of games, this freedom and liberty in playing are best incorporated in
early pen and paper and tabletop role-playing games such as the famous Dungeons and
Dragons, which serves as the beginning of role-playing as a type of game and led to
the popularity of the genre in the first place. Tabletop or pen and paper role-playing
games are typically played in a larger group of four to five players or more and one game
master that is guiding the party on their journey while challenging them with obstacles
such as puzzles, quests or enemy encounters. The players then have to use their created
character’s abilities and skills to overcome those challenges [Wri22].
Unfortunately, tabletop games come with one major flaw, as preparing a session can
be rather time-consuming and needs proper group management with campaigns usually
being played over multiple sessions of several hours. Therefore, the act of playing comes
with a lot of freedom, while the opposite is true for finding time to play. Furthermore,
tabletop games are played in a turn-based manner, meaning that only one player at a
time is allowed to take an action, which can significantly increase the time of one session,
especially when facing a combat situation.
4
2.1. Definition of the action Role-Playing Game Genre
Computer role-playing games
With the first home computers and consoles, developers started to incorporate role-
playing aspects into computer games, which led to a kind of sub-genre called computer
role-playing games.
The benefits are clear: players that own the video game and a
respective device, can play it at any time for as long as they want without the need
for preparing and making time for a specific session or managing time with other group
members. Therefore, those games are mostly played by a single player, although plenty
of multiplayer computer role-playing games exist as well.
Just like in the tabletop alternative, the player can either create their own character
or they can take on the role of a predefined hero, while sometimes they even control a
whole party of adventurers. Either way, the player will set out on an adventure of heroism,
which oftentimes follows a simple formula where “the player starts with nothing, performs
tasks for treasure and money [like] killing monsters and going on quests[...], trains [their]
skills, and eventually builds [their] character into a powerhouse figure that can then
right the ultimate wrongs of the land” [Sch09, p. 73]. The computer itself takes the
role of the dungeon master by providing the story and challenges while simultaneously
incorporating all the rules set for the game [ZD18, p. 37].
The main goal of the game is the immersion of the player. However, unlike in pen
and paper and tabletop role-playing games, the improvisational side of the genre comes
up short due to the generally scripted nature of computer games. Therefore, the story
line of these games is rather linear, or at most branches linear. So even if a computer
role-playing game provides different endings and ways to achieve a goal, players will
usually find themselves in pre-scripted situations that at best come in different states
with different character interactions and dialogues [Sch09, p. 80].
But not only the story is scripted, the players themselves are also comparatively limited
in the actions they can take. In classical pen and paper and tabletop role-playing games,
players could propose to do any action they want to their dungeon master, no matter if
there were any explicit rules for it, who then had to decide for the success of failure
of the action.
Computer role-playing games on the other hand are limited to the
actions determined by the game mechanics and features of the game [ZD18, p. 38].
To counteract this limitation, modern role-playing games usually provide “fully open,
sprawling worlds filled with other characters, monsters, places to explore, and tons of
interaction with both people and objects in the game” [Sch09, p. 70].
5
2. Fundamentals and Theoretical Background
Interaction and game mechanics can range from questing, puzzle solving, fighting mon-
sters and dungeoneering as well as simple actions like gathering resources and informa-
tion, among others.
Generally, as stated in the beginning of this chapter, this leads to modern role-playing
being more and more of a mix of different genres. The pursuing of quests may be typical
for role-playing games, but the the exploration, information gathering and problem as
well as puzzle solving side is rather typical for the adventure game genre, which is why
these two oftentimes go hand in hand [JW01, p. 1355]
Additionally, the automatism that stems from computers taking the role of the dungeon
master, led to computer role-playing games with faster gameplay. They mostly take
place in real-time scenarios, meaning that players only have a limited amount of time
to think and make a move, before the computer itself takes action. This change from
turn-based interaction and combat to real-time speed led to more and more elements of
the action genre that “focus on physical challenges that require hand-eye coordination
and quick reflexes” [Wri20] being added to the role-playing genre and therefore creating
so-called action role-playing games. Ultimately, these action elements led to combat and
skill-based challenges being more and more of a focus in modern-day role-playing.
However, designing encounters in a role-playing game is not about creating a single
opponent that is almighty but several encounters that provide challenge, but to keep
the player entertained and make them feel like the true hero of the story. Encounters
can either consist of small enemies that can be easily defeated, but attack in groups or
bigger enemies such as boss or mini-boss fights. These “Enemies and Boss Enemies are
necessary to give the player something to fight, and to provide story motivation” [Sch09,
p. 90].
All these different gameplay aspects that highly focus on interaction with the world and
its inhabitants, make artificial intelligence an intensive part of role-playing games. Hence,
the intelligence level and focus on the behavior have to be higher than in other games.
Repetitiveness or hangups in the behavior will be more noticeable, especially because
role-playing games usually require large amounts of gameplay hours to complete [Sch09,
p. 74].
Eventually in terms of this thesis, the expression action role-playing games refers to
a mixture of classic role-play with the action and adventure genre. This includes games,
that set the player out on an adventure whose primary challenge comes from a focus
on real-time combat against multiple different encounters with different amounts of

enemies and behaviors that require the player to properly use their skills and abilities as
well as to have quick reflexes and hand-eye coordination to succeed and further develop
their character.
2.2. Common Means to increase Playtime and
Replayability
Obviously, games are not the only entertainment media available. There are plenty of
books, movies or theater plays that some might consume over and over. These stories
are linear and therefore do not change. Even remakes and adaptions will most likely
have the same core to the story. Instead of the plot, it is their lyrical writing style, the
storytelling, the world building, the performance and the emotion delivered, that make
the audience want to consume these pieces again and again. Additionally, they are no
documentaries and therefore do not present facts but rather stories from people from a
different reality or time period but with such a high emphasize on detail, that it becomes
compelling to the consumer [Ada01b].
However, the main difference between classical media and games is their interactiveness
7
2. Fundamentals and Theoretical Background
and the option of decision-making. This opens up a completely different way of experi-
encing a story. However, it is important to note the joy and pleasure of playing the game
is closely tied to its interactiveness. If the interaction itself ceases to be entertaining, the
game will do the same [FGLS11, p. 18]. Therefore it is the designers’ duty, to find a back
and forth between the player and the computer, that holds the interest of the player. In
order to do so, today’s designers have a lot of tools to choose from, including artificial
intelligence, unique game mechanics, unrealistic experiences or even physics [FGLS11,
p. 18-19].
Alternative combinations of these factors will lead to different games and therefore,
varying styles of play. As there are different types of players with alternate incentives to
buy and play a game, it can be concluded that likewise there are as many reasons for a
player to replay a game.
“Some might simply enjoy the game, its immersive story, or its satisfying gameplay
and feel compelled to return for another session. Others might value customization of
play higher in terms of replayability where different choices lead to different outcomes.
Yet others might adopt a more focused goal-orientation as motivation for replaying a
game when trying to unlock every achievement the game has to offer” [Thy14, p. 8].
Looking at possible incentives, the following six aspects of replayability for games can
be formulated:
• “The experience“: the unique feeling of a game that keeps the player coming
back. This could be because of the unique gameplay, story, performance or even
nostalgia. The overall feeling of the player and therefore the essence of the game
is the most important factor for creating a lasting experience.
• Social Aspect: mostly applicable to multiplayer games, this aspect focuses on
interaction among players. This could be cooperative or competitive behavior as
well as simply exchanging thoughts, opinions or “the experience“ with one another.
• Completion: the motivation to finish a game 100%. This includes but is not
limited to finishing the story mode and side quests, exploring every corner of the
map, levelling or collecting everything there is to offer such as hidden collectables
or trophies.
• Difficulty: specifies on the challenge level of the game. It motivates the player
to beat it in the most challenging modes and therefore drives them to their best
performance.
8
2.2. Common Means to increase Playtime and Replayability
• Variety and Randomness: allows the player to play a game in multiple different
ways as well as offering them a unique experience with every single play-through.
• Learning: adding value to the life of the player by improving a certain skill and
ability, whether that be in a cognitive, physical or intellectual manner.
Some of these aspects, such as difficulty and learning, may be heavily tied together but
not limited to one another. Additionally, it is important to note, that all these aspects
for themselves, can add to the replayability of a game, but a combination of them will
ultimately hold the best results [FGLS11, p. 20-21].
To provide an in-depth view on what these aspects mean and how they can be in-
corporated into games, some of them will be explained in more detail in the following
sections.
“The experience
“ and nostalgia
“The experience“ is probably the toughest of the six presented aspects to grasp. It has a
lot to do with the feelings, that games convey and most importantly invoke in the player.
In terms of traditional media, there are a multitude of factors that need to harmonize
with each other to create a coherent image and achieve the desired effect. In the case
of theater and musicals, that is the stage design, the performance of the main and
supporting actors, the selected songs, dance numbers and, last but not least, the spoken
word. They all play an important part in conveying a certain feeling and immersing the
audience in the world of the play so that they will forget the world around them for the
duration of it. If the feeling is captured right, it does not even matter how often a single
person has seen the play already, they will still be able to find joy in it [Ada01b].
With games being interactive, designers have even more options to create a certain
feeling and experience for the player. “All it requires is knowledge of that experience and
how to recreate it. In [the case of bungee jumping], that means a large elastic rope. In
more complex cases, that can mean the structure of a game that partially defines how
the game is played” [FGLS11, p. 13]. This structure will mostly be accompanied by a
formal set of rules.
Rules can define the artificial world of the game to create a clear situation while simul-
taneously restricting the amount of possible actions of the player. While this contradicts
9
2. Fundamentals and Theoretical Background
with the “ideals of freedom“ that would be typical for role-playing games, it enables the
designers to replicate a specific scenario and therefore an experience and its associated
“magic circle“1 [SZ04, p. 4-6].
“Without rules, the activity expands to a ludic activity.
This causes the activity to
only reproduce a general feeling of risk, competition, disorientation or surrealism instead
of a specific experience within one of those domains. Without structure, the activity
becomes purely playful and simply gives the essence of freedom. [...] Every time this
combination of structure and rules is imposed, it cuts out a very specific experience”
[FGLS11, p. 13-14].
While it is important, that a situation can be replicated, only allowing this single way
of playing a game, e.g. by incorporating too many rules, will ultimately lead to less
fun. Games with only a few variables will be more limited and predictable. This can
lead to the player being in the same situation and facing the same behavior over an
over. Eventually, the overall challenge decreases due to the fact that the player can
predict what will happen by e.g. reading the opponent. This is a state that has to be
counteracted, as it makes the game prone to quickly become boring [BCCT20, p. 330].
In order to circumvent this problem, it is important to integrate slight unpredictability
and uncertainty such as “math problems [the player does not] know the solutions to, or
more variables (and less predictable ones) such as human psychology, physics, and so
on” [Kos13, p. 38]. Therefore, this form of creating an experience is directly linked to
the aspects of difficulty and variety.
The importance of creating an experience is most evident, when having a look at games
that are mostly played for nostalgic reasons. Certain games within e.g. the Metroid,
Zelda or Final Fantasy franchise, were created more than 20 years ago, but are still
loved and frequently played. Therefore, a lot of game companies started to remake or
remaster old game titles. This will not only bring the games into a new light, it also
1The “magic circle“ is basically a space and frame in which a game takes place, that separates
the world of the game from the outside world. It is “a concept connected to the question of
the ‘reality‘ of the game, of the relationship between the artificial world of the game and the
‘real life‘ context that it intersects” [SZ04, p. 2]. The “magic circle“ also serves as the frame
for the experience. Thus, breaking it will ultimately lead to a “break“ in the experience, which
is why the rules and mechanics of the game have to be adjusted to serve the needs and the
experience of it.
A fighting game for instance should not force the player to click through
menus, inventories and notes more than it does provide combat
10

enables designers to refurbish the experience on new technology and console generations
[FGLS11, p. 30-31].
Goals, completion and social aspect
“A game’s goal is often the largest single element that drives the pleasure of a player.
The goal is the ostensible reason for playing, but the goal is never easily attained; rather,
it is the obscure object of desire, the carrot held just out of reach, pulling players forward
through the varied pleasures of game play” [SZ04, p. 14-15]. Therefore, a game needs
a goal. However, this goal may not be the ultimate goal and therefore the end of the
game all the time but can come in the form of several smaller goals along the way.
Role-playing games are typically constructed in that manner.
Additionally, the goal may not always lead to the same ending. For instance, some games
incorporate multiple different endings, depending on the difficulty setting, decisions that
were made while playing or other conditions. While the ultimate desire to complete
the game remains the same, it encourages players to achieve the best ending possible
[FGLS11, p. 17].
Besides the obvious goals made by the game and its story, there are multiple ways
of generating additional incentives for the player to play in a different way and therefore,
play the game again. This could be finding all Easter eggs, collecting or crafting all
items or other collectables within the game as well as achievements and unlockables.
“Achievements and unlockables ask the player to accomplish difficult or unusual tasks
within the game[...]. If a player is aware of such achievements or unlockables, they may
replay the game to see if they can get it the second time around. In addition, these
often ask you to play the game in a less obvious way” [FGLS11, 24-25]. Adding in any
kind of statistic or collectables to a game will inevitable lead to some players aiming for
the 100% run.
Sometimes its even the players themselves, that make up goals and challenges in order to
beat a game. Events like “Games Done Quick“ feature multiple speedruns of a variety of
games and is even used to collect money for charity. On the other hand, there are certain
challenges that place an additional set of rules upon the player such as the “Nuzlocke“-
11
2. Fundamentals and Theoretical Background
challenge2 for the Pokémon games or the “Zero Death“-Challenge3 for Dark Souls.
Challenges like that are oftentimes created by community members themselves. Natu-
rally, this leads to a lot of exchange regarding the game and the challenge as well as
countless social gatherings like the previously mentioned events.
In general, games nowadays “bring a new level of statistical information to players,
giving them an uncanny level of information to rank their skills and compare with others.
Using this statistical information allows players to judge their progress and compare their
achievements with others all around the world. This massive collection and display of
statistical information creates a sense of camaraderie, rivalry and accomplishment. All
of which furthers the desire to continue playing a game” [FGLS11, p. 20].
But the social aspect of games is of course not limited to the discourse about a game
or the player’s accomplishment. Instead, a lot of games incorporate multiplayer features
which can either result in the players competing or working together while playing.
Especially the former leads to a great sense of replay value as can be seen with various
Player vs. Player games such as League of Legends, Call of Duty or Overwatch. “Human
opponents are more interesting [than virtual ones] because in addition to having varying
strategic and tactical abilities, they differ in the degree to which they’re aggressive or
defensive, devious or forthright, cautious or risk-takers. And of course, you can talk to
them. There’s a social aspect of playing against other people that is completely absent
when playing against a computer, and that tends to make the game replayable even if
nothing else does” [Ada01a].
Difficulty
It is unavoidable that the fun of a game is bound to its difficulty. So if a game fails to
provide a challenge, it becomes boring. However when looking at difficulty as a means
for replayability, it has a lot to do with which type of gamer a player is. When it comes
to general game-playing, there are two different types of players: the casual gamer and
the core gamer. The casual gamer plays for the joy of playing and seeks for variety
2A challenge that adds more rules to the game such as that the player is only allowed to catch the
first Pok´
emon they encounter on a new route or a Pok´
emon that drops to zero health points
has to be freed because it actually “died“.
3As the title suggests this means, that the game is supposed to be played without the player
dying within the game. Further, the challenge level can be increased by not being allowed to
be hit at all or attempting the run with a specific character built.
12
2.2. Common Means to increase Playtime and Replayability
in doing so (see the section about Variety and Randomness in this chapter for further
information), on the other hand, the core gamer’s primary motivation is beating the
game no matter the challenge. Their motivation is kept high, as long as the gameplay is
interesting and challenging. While this criteria is met, the core gamer will be happy to
repeat a game or a passage of a game over and over, until they succeed. However, as
soon as they beat the game or tire of the gameplay and get the feeling that they simply
cannot improve anymore, they will eventually stop playing because there seizes to be a
challenge they can overcome [Ada01a].
Usually, games will eventually have an increase in their difficulty, as the player progresses.
This could be incorporated by a difficulty curve that increases the value as soon as the
player progresses over a specific part of the story or had the opportunity to obtain a
certain item or ability [Byc09], but also by simply providing a range of difficulty settings
for the player to choose at the beginning of the game. The latter enables core gamers
to increase the overall challenge if e.g. the “normal“ setting becomes to easy. Casual
gamers on the other hand could usually play on a “easy“ or “story“ mode.
Balancing out the difficulty of a game has a lot to do with understanding the theory of
flow by Csikszentmihalyi. In general, flow is a total state of involvement and being in
flow means being in a “state in which action follows upon action according to an internal
logic which seems to need no conscious intervention on [the player’s] part” [Csi14, p.
136-137].
It is a state that one enters, when the demands of a game align with the own skills.
While in flow, the player feels that the right amount of call for action based on their
skill level is put onto them. As shown in figure 2.2, if the demand is too high, they will
feel anxious and overwhelmed. On the other hand, if the demand is too low, they will
quickly become bored and feel underwhelmed [Csi14, p. 146-147].
In order to provide some sort of fail-save for when the state of flow is disrupted by an
obstacle that seems too hard, games often provide the player with a chance of training
or leveling up for a specific encounter. That means, that “[w]hen a player encounters a
portion of the game that is too difficult, they must replay it or practice in another portion
of the game until they are able to pass it. [...] Various games employ this strategy to
keep a fairly constant risk of failure. The better a player does in these games, the harder
it gets and the more likely they will fail and therefore, replay” [FGLS11, p. 22].
13
2. Fundamentals and Theoretical Background
Figure 2.2.: Flow activity chart according to Csikszentmihalyi, that shows the rela-
tion of the challenge of the game and the skill level of the player and
the invoked emotions and feelings [Csi14, p. 147].
Nonetheless, games should still occasionally alternate action with rest phases in a level,
even while overall increasing the difficulty with progress. The latter primarily ensures that
players do not burn out as quickly as if they were permanently exposed to unpredictability
or stress due to encounters with opponents and other obstacles [Sch09, p.
37-38].
Besides, having to face challenges that are only beatable with a lot of practice will be
frustrating for some players, leading them to stop playing and not pick up the game
anymore [FGLS11, p. 22-23].
Learning
The aspect of learning as a means of repeatability is heavily tied to the difficulty of a
game. Likewise, it is closely related to behavioral theory. Almost everything humans do
and like to do is based on the basic aspect of learning or improving a skill or knowledge
they have already learnt. In this case however, learning is not tied to going to school or
university, doing homework or studying for an exam. Instead, it focuses on the activities
a person enjoys doing and considers their hobbies. Learning may come in many forms:
• Sports: exercise the body and the muscles, learning how to move in a certain
way. Especially demanding sports even exercise the brain at the same time.
• Reading books: most obviously, it will train the reading and writing skills. The
brain gets to know new words. Additionally, depending on the subject of the book,
14
2.2. Common Means to increase Playtime and Replayability
books can teach a person about certain aspects of science, the society, the “old
days“ etc.
• Talking to people: it does not really matter weather the person talking to
is a friend, family or a complete stranger, but by actively listening to others, a
person can easily broaden their horizons and maybe even see aspects of their life
or surroundings in a new light.
• Travel: getting to know and experiencing the culture of a different country.
Simply seeing other places and enjoying the locations, the food, the culture, the
people and their traditions.
The list goes on.
Just like these examples, games only remain interesting for a longer time, if they add
value to the life of the player by exercising their brain or other parts of the body. Just
like in everyday life, if one always does the same things over and over again, the activity
will eventually become second nature which will result in the brain not being engaged in
the activity anymore. As soon as that happens, boredom is inevitable [Kos13, p. 38-42].
That is why the best games follow the rule of “easy to learn, hard to master“. This
means, that “good games [should be] able to constantly teach [the player] more about
how to play them” [YT18, p. 10]. Thinking of games like Tic-Tac-Toe, there is not
much of a challenge as there is only a limited amount of moves that are possible and just
after a few turns, it already becomes clear how the game will end. Chess on the other
hand drastically raises the number of possible moves. The learning aspect of games
is inevitably the reason, why they are such a popular test-bed for artificial intelligence
implementations as well [YT18, p. 93].
Depending on the genre of the game, a multitude of learnings can be drawn from them.
Strategy and board games may train the strategical and analytic thinking side of the
brain, while puzzle and adventure games can exercise problem solving skills. Likewise,
action games enable the player to train their reflexes and hand-eye coordination. Learning
is not always about getting it right on the first try, but to keep practicing until a skill is
mastered.
One of the best genres to incorporate this style of design is the souls-like genre. It
is a sub-genre of the classic role-playing game, that originates from From Software’s
15
2. Fundamentals and Theoretical Background
“Demon’s Souls“ and “Dark Souls“ franchise. Their formula of how to create combat and
challenge has become widely popular among players and designers because it conquers
the art “of learning through practice [and] mastering the combat, [which will inevitably
lead to a great] sense of achievement when [the player] finally beat[s] an enemy [they
have] been struggling with for a while” [Bai21].
Variety and Randomization
Variety and randomness add novelty and excitement to the game. Role-playing games are
especially known for providing a vast variety of content to the player. In the role-playing
genre, this can come in the form of different classes or races, character development,
game mechanics, a vast number of individual quests, virtual character personalities,
enemy designs and encounters, cities, dungeons etc. Lately, a lot of game titles are even
advertised with bringing variety to the story by giving weight to the decisions of the
players.
Great variety in games is especially important for targeting the casual gamer. They
do not necessarily need challenge in order to continue playing a game but enjoy a great
sense of variety and content [Ada01a].
Creating all this amount of gameplay can take up a lot of manpower and especially a lot
of time. Thankfully, new technologies such as procedural content generation can assist
developers in creating more variety of content nonetheless. It helps to automatically let
the computer generate non pre-scripted worlds and levels or even dialogues and quests
automatically at runtime, which in return provides the player with far more content that
- if implemented well enough to create sufficient variety, quality and quantity - can create
open-ended games as well as add great replay value [ZD18, p. 38][YT18, p. 24].
But in order to create variety, developers are not necessarily required to add more and
more content. Instead it can suffice to simply provide the player with different ways of
playing a game or adding in random elements that add a sense of uncertainty so that
even if the initial state of the game is the same, it can unfold into a different direction.
A good example for this would be classical board games where the initial state of the
game remains the same but the course of the game is determined by throwing dice or
games that provide the player with varying starting conditions such as a different starting
hand in card games.
16
2.2. Common Means to increase Playtime and Replayability
Of course it is not only possible to create different play sessions by using random aspects.
Instead, additional features such as classes or a skill tree enable the players themselves
to create different experiences with every play-through, as they can shape their character
differently each time. This will most likely result in adapting to a different style of play
for the player in order to finish the game. That is why it is also important to create
the possibility to deal with obstacles such as puzzles and encounters in multiple different
ways, even if the ultimate goal and outcome might be the same [Ada01a].
Besides, “it is crucial in a game that players don’t know exactly how it will play out.
Think about it: if you knew who was going to win a game before it started, would you
even bother to play” [SZ04, p. 174]?
Figure 2.3.: Slay the Spire: a rogue like card game, available on Steam, Switch,
Playstation and Xbox.
One very good example for this is the rogue-like card game Slay the Spire (see figure 2.3).
Just like any other rogue like, the player is tasked to complete procedurally generated
dungeons with multiple stages that include encounters and mini-bosses as well as a final
boss. The structure of a dungeon has a similar yet alternate structure each run and
consists of several rooms, that can either be enemy or mini-boss encounters, a campfire
at which the player can restore health or improve their deck, treasures, shops or rooms
that provide a short story followed by a decision. While progressing through the dungeon,
the player can improve the strength of their cards or add new ones to their deck as well
as find special relics that provide passive bonuses throughout the fight. Additionally, the
player can choose between four characters which come with different deck builds and
styles of play such as a typical Barbarian or Rogue. The randomized structure of the
17
2. Fundamentals and Theoretical Background
dungeon paired with the deck building aspect creates a huge amount of possibilities for
styles of play each run, which keeps the game interesting.
Furthermore, it is possible to create incentives for players to replay a game by simply
adding in new content such as events or other downloadable contents that e.g. provide
a new story arc. However, in order for this strategy to work, timing is crucial as players
may have already moved on to a different game, while adding it too soon will result
in players seeing new content as a given part of the game, which can result in players
abandoning the game sooner, especially when the developers do not keep on providing
more [FGLS11, p. 31].
Critical look at replay value
As declared previously, adding replay value can drastically increase the quality and value
of a game in the eyes of the player, as they easily get the feeling of “getting their moneys
worth“. However, in order for a games company to make profit, it is necessary to balance
out the amount of replayability with the need of the player to simply get more. On one
hand, replayability is necessary to grow popularity for a franchise or future games of the
development studio, on the other hand, players need to have an incentive to purchase
other games as well as future productions [Ada01a].
2.3. Artificial Intelligence and its Relationship with
Video Games
In modern-day society, everybody, even from a young age, has heard of the term artificial
intelligence at least once in their lives.
Even more so, everyone owning at least a
smartphone comes in contact with artificial intelligence every day.
It can be found
everywhere, whether it is in filters on Social Media, Smart Home Devices, Navigation
Technology, search algorithms, recommendation services of streaming platforms of any
kind, dating apps or even things as simple as the auto-correct function on phones or
computers. Artificial intelligence makes the lives of humans easier by helping them do
and find the things that matter to them more easily, while also keeping them entertained.
Consequently, it is not astonishing that a large variety of aspects of artificial intelligence
18
2.3. Artificial Intelligence and its Relationship with Video Games
are used in one of the largest entertainment sectors today: video and computer games.
However, although artificial intelligence is such a profound aspect of everyone’s lives,
the term itself remains unclear for the majority. The following chapter serves as a means
for clarifying the concept itself. Furthermore, it will highlight the relationship and bond
between video games and artificial intelligence and how it progressed from its beginning
to its current state.
2.3.1. Basic Understanding of Intelligence and Artificial
Intelligence
Definition of Intelligence
In order to be able to understand the term “artificial intelligence“ it is first important, to
define and understand the term “intelligence“ first. Finding a definition for the term
is rather complicated, and has been debated for a long time.
Generally speaking,
intelligence is “the capacity to acquire and apply knowledge [that] demonstrates the
faculty of thought and reason” [Sch09, p. 2].
However, this definition can be further expanded.
In fact, many different forms of
intelligence exist that address different parts of the brain. These forms include but are
not limited to linguistic intelligence, critical thinking, abstraction, logic and problem
solving, spatial intelligence, creativity, body coordination, planning, self-awareness as
well as empathy or awareness towards others and towards the natural world. Each of
these forms of intelligence work as a separate system, although they can interact with
each other to create intelligent performances [Ste15, p. 229]. The distinctness of each
intelligence varies from person to person, but can be further enhanced and manifested
through training and practice [Sch09, p. 11]. “True intelligence“ is demonstrated, when
one can acquire knowledge and apply it within a variety of contexts.
Definition of Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence on the other hand is the modelling process of intelligence with
especial focus on human intelligence. Its “aim [is] to make computers perform tasks that
have at some point been considered to require intelligence to perform” [YT18, p. 7].
19
2. Fundamentals and Theoretical Background
These tasks can require any of the previously mentioned forms of intelligence and can be
either of cognitive or behavioral nature and depict human and rational thinking, though
the two sometimes contradict [Sch09, p. 2].
“[I]n practice, the term refers to a spectrum of ideas ranging from a simple system that
can perform only basic tasks to a fully adaptive system that is able to solve highly
complex problems by using techniques that reflect the nature of human intelligence”
[JW01, p. 1356]. Depending on the underlying research background the importance of
modeling true human cognition varies. Naturally, the research field has “two main goals.
First is [...] understand[ing] intelligent entities, which will, in turn, help [...] understand
[humans]. Second is to build intelligent entities, for fun and profit, [...] because it turns
out that these intelligent entities can be useful in [...] everyday live[ of humans]” [Sch09,
p. 8].
In case of this thesis, the focus lies on games and the behavior of the virtual opponents
within the game.
Therefore, it is not necessary to create human cognition or even
simulate learning but simply to simulate behavior that seems intelligent.
The relationship between Artificial Intelligence and Games
For decades, video game development and research into artificial intelligence modeling
methods have influenced each other. Insights and breakthroughs in one of the two areas
always ensure progress in the other [BKT14, p 537]. This is not at all surprising “as
games were one of the first software systems interacting with humans on a rather high
level” [Kuf18].
Furthermore, games themselves require effort and skill to be completed which are tied
to cognitive and behavioral intelligence. Games usually provide the player with a variety
of possible moves and actions to choose from, which leads to a variety of strategies for
winning and finishing the game. These strategies are modeled by using a tree structure,
with the nodes of the tree being the different states the game can end up in and the
edges being the action or move that leads to that state. Due to the vast number of
possibilities of actions and states that can even exceed the number of visible atoms in
the universe, these trees naturally grow big quite easily. Hence, calculating the best
move to win becomes a much harder and more complex problem for computers than for
humans, which overall is the reason why games are a particularly exciting subject for
computer scientists and thus artificial intelligence research [YT18, p. 15-16][Kuf18].
20
2.3. Artificial Intelligence and its Relationship with Video Games
When looking at the different problems games provide for artificial intelligence imple-
mentations and methods, they can be sorted into four different subcategories:
• perfect information games: games in which all players are aware and informed
about the moves and actions of the other players as well as the current state of
the game and all possible moves and actions. Classical examples are two-player
board games such as Chess or Checkers.
• imperfect information games: games, the current state of which is not fully
known to all players. Typically card games with face-down cards such as Poker
fall into this category.
• stochastic games: games whose possible moves and actions are determined
randomly and can change each turn. This includes all games that are played using
dice or another form of randomness such as Backgammon or Ludo.
• interactive games: games that provide a repertoire of actions and different
strategies for the players to pursue in order to be able to reach a certain goal.
Sometimes they even provide the player with the possibility to define their own
goals. Usually, video games as well as classical pen and paper games fall into this
category.
Obviously, video games are overall categorized as interactive games. However, parts of a
game can also fall into one of the other sub-categories, making it a mixture of different
problems to solve. This is especially true when games feature mini-games [BKT14, p.
532-534].
Generally, the foundation of video games is the same: they consist of a staged scenario
created by the game designers and developers. The scenario on the other hand, can
be fairly different. Some video game genres such as real-time-strategy games are fairly
similar to classical board games and therefore serve as an extension of them, while others
such as the role-playing genre are heavily influenced by movie culture. Therefore, they
are more like interactive movies and stories. Depending on the amount of scripting and
streamlining, the player can either create their own story in a rich environment or follow
a scripted and streamlined path. The latter usually follows a rather scripted approach
when it comes to the implementation of behaviors, that follow the designers intentions
and that, due to the scripted nature, contradicts with the usual understanding of artificial
21
2. Fundamentals and Theoretical Background
intelligence [BCCT20, p. 328-330].
In general, agents for interactive games require a mixture of strategic and reactive
behaviors which is not at all trivial to achieve, especially with the action space oftentimes
being much bigger than the one of classical board games [BKT14, p. 535].
Requirements for Non-Player behavior in interactive
environments
One of the key topics for artificial intelligence in video games is the development of
virtual characters and their behaviors. In order to be considered good, they have to be
credible, somewhat realistic and imitate intelligent behavior. Oftentimes, they are the
reason for players to feel engaged in a game as they provide the source of conflict or
story. Virtual characters can either take the role of an opponent or an ally. The first
being the one that is most key to this thesis. Additionally, the artificial intelligence of
a game has become one of the major promotional materials in the marketing of games.
Therefore, its implementation and design is capable of either making or breaking a game
[BCCT20, p. 329][Kuf18].
In case of games, it is the behavioral mechanics of the game that is oftentimes referred
to as artificial intelligence, though the term is not particularly true and is used for close
to everything that is steered by behavior of a character or the environment in the virtual
world.
However, in fact the mechanics used are oftentimes the same functions and
mechanics a player is using and the algorithms and structures triggering them are mostly
scripted [Vya20][Sch09, p. 3]. This is especially the case, because most game genres that
are known today have evolved from earlier video game designs where artificial intelligence
was simply not as present as today (see chapter 2.3.2 for further details) and have been
designed to not need it in the first place [YT18, p. 14].
For the player and the designer of games, it is only really important to know the outcome
of behavior, not how it is achieved or how the algorithms work. Designers intent to create
an experience that players can enjoy [Sch09, p. 7]. Therefore, unexpected behavior is
not desired, which is why true learning algorithms are rarely used in most video games.
Instead, it is oftentimes behavior trees and state machines coupled with fuzzy logic, that
are doing the trick. The current state of the character is abstracted using characteristic
elements such as its position in the world, available tools and weapons as well as the
distance to the player and their temper among others. Depending on the values, the
22
2.3. Artificial Intelligence and its Relationship with Video Games
virtual character then forms decisions on what to do such as where to go or which action
to take. Depending on the game genre, those strategies can be further mixed with other
methods on how to create artificial intelligence [BKT14, p. 534-535].
Depending on what designers hope to achieve from the creation of artificial intelligence,
other criteria arise that must be met. If there is a desire to create a certain experience,
predictable and often rational opponents are used, whereas characters that are supposed
to simulate a human opponent must have a spark of unpredictability, just as human
behavior is sometimes unpredictable and not rational [YT18, p. 96]. However, the latter
is oftentimes not as fun for the player [Vya20]. This fact, that artificial intelligence and
its behavior is created in order to fulfill design standards makes balancing and perfecting
the implementation so hard. In order to make the players happy and give them a good
experience, the designers are “better off having an [artificial intelligence] that was just
above average all the time, rather than one that was brilliant 98[%] of the time and
stupid 2[%] of the time” [Cas02, p. 41]. This can only be achieved by continual testing
and iteration. So at one point the creation of behavior becomes some sort of trial and
error which results in it “not [being] the best code[, but instead] it is the best use of
code and a large dollop of ‘whatever works‘. Some of the smartest-looking games have
used very questionable methods to achieve their solutions [in order] to give the illusion
of intelligence and enhances the fun factor of the game” [Sch09, p. 7].
When looking at the behavior of characters in games, it is also important to note that
the players themselves do not necessarily play for the sole purpose of winning, beating
or completing a game. Instead, they may play because they want to pass time, relax,
explore etc. Creating an artificial intelligence that simply wants to win can sometimes
even lead to behavior that is not at all predictable or fun to watch. The opposite might
be true. So the focus should really lie on how to create a human-like and believable
behavior, instead of one behavior that is superior and beats the player every time [YT18,
p. 91][Sch09, p. 8-9].
This human-like and believable behavior means, “that [the virtual character should]
ha[ve] performance comparable to a human, has similar reaction speed, makes the same
sort of mistakes that a human would do, is curious about and explores the same areas
as a human would” [YT18, p. 94] and so on.
Enhanced reflexes and skills on the other hand would not only create incredible non-
human-like behavior but could also discourage the player from playing, as they may get
the feeling that it takes otherworldly reflexes in order to be able to use the mechanics and
23
2.3. Artificial Intelligence and its Relationship with Video Games
players themselves, e.g. when switching to an autopilot-mode, for gameplay showcasing,
simulating human opponents or simply for easy play-testing purposes.
2.3.2. A brief History of Artificial Intelligence in Video Games
In the past 30 years, interactive computer and video games have become one of the most
important research fields and areas of application for artificial intelligence. Nowadays
there is close to no modern video game that does not make usage of the latest artificial
intelligence models and their algorithms [BKT14, p. 534]. “Thus, [it is no surprise, that]
the use of [artificial intelligence] techniques has increasingly become a necessity in order
for a game to stand out in the market. Moreover, as more games incorporate functional
and impressive [artificial intelligence] techniques, users’ expectations and demands in-
crease and a game that fails to employ effective [artificial intelligence] is less likely to be
well received” [JW01, p. 1356]. But obviously this is the current state of the industry
and was not always the case in the past. In fact, research on artificial intelligence as a
general topic in academics dates back as far as the 1950s, making the subject itself a
particularly young one in the sense of science [Sch09, p. 1].
The history of artificial intelligence with games differs when looking at analogous games,
such as board or card games, and computer or video games. As stated in chapter 2.3.1, in
terms of artificial intelligence, games can further be sorted into four different categories
“perfect information games“, “imperfect information games“, “stochastic games“ and
“interactive games“. Naturally, just like with genres, more than one may apply to a
game at a time. Typically most analogous games fall into at least one or more of the
first three categories, while computer and video games naturally classify as “interactive“,
but can also incorporate parts of the other three categories.
Artficial intelligence for board games
Early research on artificial intelligence in games initially focused on games that were
classified as “perfect information games“ with particular focus being placed on the games
of Chess, Checkers and Go. Just like most other board games at the time, the two most
required skills for a player to be able to play and perform well were analysis and reasoning
[BCCT20, p. 327]. Typically these games consisted of a staged conflict between two
25
2. Fundamentals and Theoretical Background
players. Games with these specifications were particularly easy to formulate in terms
of artificial intelligence research because the moves executed lead to only a limited
number of possible game states that were clear, comprehensible and predictable to all
parties involved. These states can be easily modeled using discrete structures, the most
commonly used one being search trees.
First approaches to programming a chess computer, by means of search trees, were
already proposed in the 1950s by Claude E. Shannon.
Shannon’s proposal was to
calculate every possible state the game could end up in within a limited amount of
moves starting from its current state. These states and the moves that lead to them
were then stored in a search tree. Cost functions would be used to measure the goodness
of the respective move, with particularly good ones being the ones that either maximized
the own or minimized the opponent’s chance of winning. However, first implementations
of this simple tree search method quickly proved to be impractical due to the exponential
growth of the size of the tree and the resulting computational cost. Hence, the approach
was later further improved by e.g. using heuristics that allowed the algorithms to only
expand on the nodes that proved to be especially promising, resulting in some of the
most known and still well used approaches such as the alpha-beta pruning or the A∗
algorithms [BKT14, p. 532-533].
The fact that these and similar algorithms, as well as the application of machine learning
techniques, are still widely used today proves, that solving problems related to “perfect
information games“ is a major achievement in the history of artificial intelligence. Thanks
to major breakthroughs such as the DeepBlue Chess bot or the Logistello Othello bot,
both of which beat their respective world champions as early as 1997, these types of
games and related problems can be considered solved within the research field [BKT14,
p.
532-533].
Even the world champion in the game Go, which until then was still
considered too difficult a problem, was defeated by AlphaGo back in 2017 [YT18, p.
16].
Artficial intelligence for computer and video games
Turning the focus on computer and video games, history is rather different. One of the
reasons for that is the fact that they fall into a different category of artificial intelligence
problems than the previously examined board games. Most obviously, they differ in being
26
2.3. Artificial Intelligence and its Relationship with Video Games
“interactive games“. Usually these games have a larger set of actions to choose from,
but the information about the moves, stats and abilities one character holds are not
necessarily openly communicated to the counterpart. This drives video games more into
the direction of “imperfect information games“. Consequently, that means that unknowns
and probabilities have to be taken into account when predicting and calculating possible
moves, which in return complicates the classification of good and bad ones. In result,
classical tree search was not efficient enough to solve the problems that come with the
creation of behavior of virtual characters in computer and video games.
The complexity of the problem lead to artificial intelligence being not being prominent
at all in the first video games released in the 1970s. This was mainly due to the early
state of research and general hardware limitations such as the shortage of processor
speed and the lack of memory storage [YT18, p. 11]. Consequently, even though virtual
characters and their behavior was a large focus for development even in early days,
the first implementations of behaviors of Non-Playable Characters were very simple
and mostly scripted [YT18, p.
11] meaning they mainly consisted of repetitive and
predetermined patterns of a certain type of motion and attack which were chained
together in a seemingly “random“ fashion4.
The main reason for the usage of this method was its easy and efficient way to cope with
said hardware limitations due to the fact that “[p]atterns could be stored easily, requiring
minimal code to drive them, and required no calculation” [Sch09, p. 5]. Accordingly,
the key difference between classical board games and most video games was their way of
providing challenge to players. Board games mostly demanded situational analysis and
reasoning, while their digital counterpart was highly interactive and therefore heavily
required quick reflexes paired with pattern analysis [BCCT20, p. 327].
In order to still be able to provide a challenge for the player when the implementation
fails and the opponent therefore falls behind in competitive situations, early behavior
development oftentimes involved cheating mechanisms for the virtual characters. This
meant, the artificial intelligence had additional information about the game and the world
or certain skills that the player did not have and was not able to acquire. This could be
accessing certain variables that determined the state of the game or the player and use
4Since computers are generally deterministic systems that allow little unpredictability, in the
context of computer programs such as video games, there is no such thing as true“randomness“,
which is why computer scientists refer to it as so-called “pseudo-randomness“, which is based
on special mathematical algorithms and calculations.
27
2. Fundamentals and Theoretical Background
that to their advantage or manipulating random factors or physics.
An example for the first could be tracking down when a player is pressing the attack
key in order to be able to perform a block or dodge in the right moment or knowing
where to access certain resources in a strategy game without the need of searching for
it. The most prominent example for the latter would be rubber-banding in racing games,
meaning that e.g. virtual characters that fall behind get better items or simply drive
faster than what is usually possible in order to catch up with the player and thereby
rejoining the competition.
These cheating mechanisms are meant to create a more challenging situation for the
player, however they had to be subtle enough to slip past their attention. Otherwise,
they create the opposite situation and therefore lead to less satisfying opponents that
leave the player feeling betrayed rather than entertained and immersed [BKT14, p.
534][Sch09, p. 5].
Evidently, considering the simplicity of the behavior of most virtual characters and sys-
tems in video games’ early days, artificial intelligence was not their primary selling point.
Instead, game development focused heavily on making games look good by ultimately
increasing their overall graphical look. This “early emphasis on graphics eventually led
to specialized graphics processors on almost every platform, and the main CPU[, whose
specification has likewise greatly improved over the years, was] increasingly being left
open for more and more sophisticated [artificial intelligence] routines” [Sch09, p. 6],
meaning that instead of devoting 1 to 2% of CPU time to calculating artificial intelligence
elements, today’s standard lies around 10 to 35% or even higher than that [Sch09, p. 6]
while at the same time with the increase of “the average home PC[’s specification], the
same percentage of CPU processing power allows far more advanced techniques than it
did three years ago5” [JW01, p. 1356].
With these advances of hardware capabilities, scripted behavior that relied on patterns
such as moving from left to right and occasionally shooting was no longer sufficient.
Instead, especially for the genre of adventure and role-playing games, the focus shifted
towards a more sophisticated behavior that would make virtual characters pass as intel-
ligent, with the main goal of making them more realistic, credible and ultimately more
entertaining and immersive for the player [BCCT20, p. 327]. That means, that the
virtual characters not necessarily have to be intelligent in the classical goal of artificial
intelligence research, but rather need to seem like they are behaving intelligently. So
5published in 2001, therefore referring to the late 90s
28
2.3. Artificial Intelligence and its Relationship with Video Games
the goal really was to mimic and replicate a behavior that simulates the same cognitive
skills and abilities of a human player.
This of course makes for a not at all trivial task to achieve, especially because true
human like behavior requires a rather elaborate combination of re-activeness paired with
tactical and strategic thinking. This means, that virtual characters need to be able to
perform quick actions in regards to the current state of the game while also planning
ahead in regards to medium-term as well as long-term goals. This intricacy emerges
from the fact that games themselves become more realistic and therefore complex. In
contrast, a ghost in the early arcade game Pac-Man did have a lot less tactical options
and behavioral capabilities than a teammate or opponent in a modern day action game
or shooter [BKT14, p. 535].
Modern day artificial intelligence in the games industry
Modern day artificial intelligence is oftentimes still created by using rule based systems
such as behavior trees but combined with fuzzy logic. This means, that the current state
of the character is characterized using a variety of abstract variables such as their position,
available items, distance to other players, etc. Depending on the state, reasonable actions
will then be generated by either using deterministic or random methods. This evaluation
allows for rather elaborate behaviors as well as team play mechanics.
Over the years these techniques have been further improved and adapted to different
games and their needs [BKT14, p. 534-535]. This also leads to the usage of more
complex artificial intelligence techniques like heuristic search, learning and planning. As
a result, by the standards of academic research, modern artificial intelligence in games
is evolving more and more in the direction of real intelligence, so that predefined and
scripted patterns and behaviors are eventually becoming a matter of the past [Sch09, p.
5]
Still, classical learning algorithms take a significantly longer time to develop and design
than is the case with classical behavior pattern creation. Learning usually requires many
iterations, balancing as well as readjusting by designers and developers in order to work
the way it is intended to work. In a game with significantly more opponents, this could
drastically increase development time, which is why it is necessary to balance the pros
and cons of machine learning before incorporating it into the project.
29
2. Fundamentals and Theoretical Background
This may change in the future when speed and accuracy are further increased, but for
now, most games that use learning technique only do activate it during production and
then ship the game with the learning disabled to keep the behavior as stable as possible
[Sch09, p. 14].
Nowadays, some problems of artificial intelligence in video games can be considered
solved. This mainly applies to simple puzzle games or games that require dexterity and
skill. Jump-and-run games such as Super Mario whose main problem is the navigation
through the level can easily be solved by using pathfinding algorithms such as A∗.
However, despite major advancements in terms of other problems considering behavior,
there is still no ultimate and generic solution that can be applied to any type of game
and genre in sight [BKT14, p. 535]. “Right now, game [artificial intelligence] is still very
game-specific and very much in the hands of the coders who work on it” [Sch09, p. 7-8].
Still, “[i]t seems that we have long reached an era where the primary focus of the
application of [artificial intelligence] in the domain of games is not [solely] on agents
and NPC behaviors. The focus has, instead, started to shift towards interweaving game
design and game technology by viewing the role of [artificial intelligence] holistically and
integrating aspects of procedural content generation and player modeling within the very
notion of game [artificial intelligence]” [YT18, p. 15].
So instead of simply focusing on the behavioral side, research is shifting more towards
enhancing the overall experience while also making the production of games easier and
faster.
This includes the creation of stories, levels, music as well as balancing and
testing the difficulty of the games or things as simple as smoothing certain controls like
the camera movement and placement [BCCT20, 332-333].
30
3. Artificial Intelligence Methods and
Variations commonly used in Modern Day
Video Games
3.1. Opponent and Character Artificial Intelligence
As already described in chapter 2.3, many possibilities have opened up over the research
period for modeling artificial intelligence and using it in games. The best-known strate-
gies arguably represent so-called “ad-hoc behavior authoring methods“. These include
Finite State Machines as well as Behavior Trees [YT18, p. 32].
Due to their simplicity and flexibility in creation as well as in testing and debugging,
they are very popular in artificial intelligence development, especially in the role-playing
genre, where the creation of many different enemies and behaviors is common.
The main difference between the two is that a Behavior Tree refers to the modeling
of decision-making processes of a virtual character in the game world, whereas Finite
State Machines describe the behavior of a character by means of different states between
which it can switch [MH17, p. 172]. A more detailed distinction and explanation of the
techniques underlying these methods is given in the following chapters.
3.1.1. Finite State Machines
The task of a Finite State Machine is to model the current state a virtual character is
in. However, it is also possible to model, for example, the current game state or the
state of the world within a Finite State Machine. The word “finite“ is very important in
this context, as it symbolizes that only a finite set of possible states which a system can
be may exist at a time [JW01, p. 1355][Vya20]. Possible examples of states a virtual
character can be in are walking, attacking or patrolling.
31
3. Artificial Intelligence Methods and Variations commonly used in
Modern Day Video Games
Visually, this Finite State Machines are directed graphs where the nodes represent the
different states. These nodes are then connected by so-called “transitions“, allowing the
entity to switch from one state to another. However, the direction in which the transition
points is important as it is only possible to switch into that direction, not vice versa.
Whether or not a transition is performed, is determined by set conditions for the tran-
sition. Those conditions could require certain parameters to take an expected value or
certain triggers to be set. Through the use of random numbers or fuzzy logic a certain
degree of unpredictability can be added to this process and thereby the behavior of the
entity [Cas02, p. 41].
Simply put, Finite State Machines consist of the following three components:
• “A number of states which store information about a task—e.g., [the current state
being] the explore state.
• A number of transitions between states which indicate a state change and are
described by a condition that needs to be fulfilled—e.g., if [...] a fire [is] shot,
move to the alerted state.
• A set of actions that need to be followed within each state—e.g., while in the
explore state move randomly and seek opponents“ [YT18, p. 33].
An example for a often used Finite State Machine within the Unity Engine are their
Animator components.
As described in the previous section, state machines can also be used to model the
current state of a game or a character within the game. “Thus, [a game] could have an
NPC who first meets a player and gives the player a quest (for example, state before
meeting the player is stateintro, changing to statequest after giving the player information
about a quest). Then, after the player finishes the quest, the NPC becomes a shopkeeper
and sells the player things at a discount as a reward (stateshopkeep)” [Sch09, p. 81].
3.1.2. Behavior Trees
Behavior Trees have “become the leading [artificial intelligence] technique in the video
game industry over the last decade” [BCCT20, p. 330]. They are used to create the
behavior of a virtual character by modelling its decision making process.
32
3.1. Opponent and Character Artificial Intelligence
As its name suggests, Behavior Trees resemble a graph with a tree structure.
The
tree is shown as in 3.1 with the root node at the top. All further levels of the tree are
arranged below this root node. The tree is then read and executed from the top left to
the bottom right starting with the root node, though the child nodes of a parent node
are always explored first before switching to the next node of the same layer [YT18, p.
34-35][MH17, p. 172].
The nodes represent so-called “tasks“, which are all based on the same interface and
Figure 3.1.: Example for a Behavior Tree labeled as “simple attacker“ [MH17, p.
172]
thus have the same API functions. After the execution of such a node or task, it reports
a specified status back to its parent node. In most implementations, this status takes
one of three values: Running, Success, and Failure. However, some implementations
may additionally use an Error value [Kl"15, p. 511][YT18, p. 34-35].
The following conclusions can be drawn about the execution of the node by means of
the return value:
• Success: the task was successfully executed and completed
• Failure: the task was executed completely, but it was not successful with respect
to the purpose of execution (for example, because a condition was not met)
• Running: the execution of the task has not yet been completed. The task needs
a new execution or waits e.g. for the finished execution of another node or the
fulfillment of a certain condition.
33
3. Artificial Intelligence Methods and Variations commonly used in
Modern Day Video Games
Figure 3.2.: Example for the interface and the execution order of the task API of the
behavior designer asset (opsive.com/support/documentation/behavior-
designer/tasks/)
• Error: indicates that an error has occurred during the execution of the task.
The root node also returns a value at the end of the execution of the entire Behavior
Tree, which allows conclusions to be drawn about the execution of the entire tree [MH17,
p. 173].
In addition, tasks are assigned to one of four categories:
• Actions “encapsulate[...] an action to be performed” [MH17, p. 1].
• “Conditions are used to test properties of the environment with boolean-valued
functions” [Kl"15, p. 511].
• Composites “act[...] as a control flow component that directs traversal over the
tree” [MH17, p. 1].
• “Decorator[s] add [..] complexity to and enhance [...] the capacity of a single child
behavior [...] includ[ing] the number of times a child behavior runs or the time
given to a child behavior to complete the task” [YT18, p. 34-35]. Additionally,
certain types of decorators can be used to manipulate the return status of a child
node.
Actions and Conditions tend to act as the ends of a branch of the tree, whereas Decora-
tors and Composites typically have at least one child node. “Note that the statuses within
a Behavior Tree are continuously evaluated. Each composite task reacts immediately to
changes in its sub-tasks” [Kl"15, p. 512].
34
3.2. Meta Artificial Intelligence
However, what this response ultimately looks like depends heavily on the nature of
the composite task. Besides Parallel tasks, used to execute multiple branches of a tree
simultaneously, the two most commonly used composites are Sequences and Selectors.
Selector nodes succeed, if one of their child nodes returns success. On a failed child
node, the next child in order is executed. If there are no more children left, the selector
itself returns failure [YT18, p. 34-35]. Therefore, selectors are often “used to provide
several alternatives to achieve a common goal. When comparing to logic, selectors can
be regarded as an OR-operator” [Kl"15, p. 511].
Sequences on the other hand work like procedures in a regular coding script: they execute
all their children from left to right. If the children all return success, the sequence returns
success as well. If one of the childnodes fails however, the sequence aborts the execution
of the rest of the children and returns failure as well [YT18, p. 34-35]. Sequences
“describe a series of tasks in order to achieve higher-level goals. Sequences correspond
to the logical AND-operator” [Kl"15, p. 511].
3.2. Meta Artificial Intelligence
Unlike the name might suggest, the term meta artificial intelligence has little to do with
the social media company formerly known as Facebook. Instead, it describes a form of
usage of an artificial intelligence and learning algorithms that use the parts of a game’s
meta data in order to be able to adjust and therefore balance out difficulty settings at
runtime to suit the players skill level and abilities.
Up until now, “in many games, the pace and difficulty of the game is predetermined by the
game designer and does not change dynamically during play. The game designer carefully
adjusts the parameters such that most players (or a representative player) experiences
enjoyment. [...] However, as the skills of players and the game situations are diverse, it
is not easy for every player to enjoy exactly the same content” [SM20, p. 3].
In fact, depending on the game, the skill level of two players can be completely different
[XWK+17, p. 465]. Nevertheless, the incentive of game designers should be to provide
all players with an immersive and fulfilling experience. To achieve this goal, the difficulty
of a game should always be kept in the perfect state between over- and underchallenge.
This state is also referred to as “flow“ [Csi14, p. 136-137]. If the difficulty level is
35
3. Artificial Intelligence Methods and Variations commonly used in
Modern Day Video Games
persistently too high or too low for a player’s current skill level, there is a high probability
that the player will cease playing the game.
This is where the meta artificial intelligence comes into play: its “basic idea [...] is to
dynamically control the contents of the game according to the skill of the player and the
game situation, such that various players experience a more interesting game” [SM20,
p. 3].
This concept has already been successfully used in video games like World of Warcraft
or Left for Dead. But while World of Warcraft simply adjusted the difficulty of enemies
and the game challenge to the players needs, in Left for Dead an artificial intelligence
director controlled parts of the entire game world. This includes parts of levels, the
spawn locations of enemies and their behavior, as well as sequences of tasks and quests
were dynamically generated among others. The use of this technique made for varied
and exciting gameplay even after multiple hours of play [BKT14, p. 535-536].
Another example is the companion system in Final Fantasy XV. Here, the developers
used the meta artificial intelligence to improve the behavior of the player’s allies by
making the artificial intelligence “analyze [...] the battle situation and direct [...] an
appropriate ally [...] to help the player when in a difficult situation or to follow when the
player is running away” [SM20, p. 5].
Even in online games, where players compete against each other, artificial intelligence can
help pair players with equally skilled opponents in order to create the fairest competition
possible. Similar to matchmaking in chess, elo1 value methods are used in connection
with Bayesian probability models [BKT14, p. 536].
Not only is this kind of artificial intelligence exciting within combat situations. Alterna-
tively, by analyzing the current flow and pacing, it can be used to adjust other content
factors such as music, terrain, or the course of the current storyline, thus influencing
practically the entire game [SM20, p. 1-2]. By using such technology in conjunction
with other methods like procedural content generation, completely customized game
experiences can be created.
It is not only the players who benefit from the use of this type of artificial intelligence.
Game designers can also benefit from it, as data is collected that shows how the corre-
sponding game needs to be adjusted in order to provide the desired gaming experience to
1A system that was originally invented to rank players according to their skill level in playing
chess. Nowadays this is a common value used in other competetive gamess, including online
games that focus on Player vs. Player combat.
36
3.2. Meta Artificial Intelligence
the widest possible range of players. For example, if the game is consistently indicated
to be too difficult, game designers can simplify the default state of the game [XWK+17,
p. 466].
In order to make these adjustments, hidden meta data is collected, which can be used
to calculate a kind of difficulty evaluation score. This score then defines how spawn
behavior, enemy behavior and the game’s difficulty evolve. The resulting patterns could
look like this: “‘if the difficulty is 10 then three Type-A enemies appear‘ and ‘if the
difficulty is 20 then four Type-A and five Type-B enemies appear.‘
As long as the
player proceeds in the game, increasingly stronger enemies appear, but when the player
is defeated, the enemies return to weakness” [SM20, p. 3].
However, a distinction has to be made between different types of players, as “[c]autious
players and risk takers [...] behave differently in response to dynamic balancing mechan-
ics” [XWK+17, p. 466].
Evaluation of the score could, for example, be calculated as depending on the damage
the player received over a certain period of time as well as on the length of rest periods
the player has between two fights.
Additionally, methods exist to draw conclusions about the player’s stress perception by
determining physiological data such as body temperature or pulse rate and to adapt the
game content accordingly [SM20, p. 6]. However, “the majority of [dynamic difficulty
adjustment] systems rely upon prediction and intervention as their fundamental strategy”
[XWK+17, p. 466].

4. Conducting a Field Test to evaluate the
Replay Value of Combat Balancing
Methods
4.1. Presentation of the Practical Execution
As mentioned in the introduction chapter, the goal of this bachelor thesis is to find
out how to create replay value for action role-playing games through combat between
the player and the game’s virtual opponents. Most importantly in the course of this
study, the replay value has to stem from the artificial intelligence implementation and
its balancing, rather than new game design features and adjustments or aesthetically
pleasing graphics and special effects. Considering these requirements in combination
with the most commonly used tactics to increase the replay value of a game, gradually
increasing the difficulty of a game proves to be the best way to achieve this goal.
4.1.1. Combat Difficulty Balancing Approaches used in the
Practical Field Test
As stated in chapter 2.2, in order to achieve replayability through difficulty, it is important
to keep the player in a constant state of flow, meaning that it is required to remain a
constant balance between the skill level of the player and the demand for action, reflexes
and strategy. This naturally means that the difficulty has to be increased through the
course of a game. The challenge then arises from the stress of constant risk of failure
that the player has to overcome by appropriately using their previously acquired skills.
While there are several methods on how to increase the difficulty of a game, the two
being most interesting for the purpose of this study are a mathematical and a behavioral
approach. The behavioral approach will be the main focus of this study, as it is highly
39
4. Conducting a Field Test to evaluate the Replay Value of Combat
Balancing Methods
focusing on alternating the behavior of an enemy which can be done using artificial
intelligence implementations. Ultimately, the goal of this thesis is about to examine how
replay value of a game can be achieved by using behavioral approaches, hence this is the
approach that this thesis examines for its effectiveness in regards to balancing difficulty.
The mathematical approach on the other hand, is already commonly used to balance
difficulty and has due already proven to be effective in doing so. Therefore, the findings
of the test using the mathematical approach will be used as control results to be able
to achieve a higher level of precision within the evaluation process for the outcomes of
the behavioral approach.
Balancing difficulty by using a mathematical approach
This is the most commonly used technique to balance combat and its difficulty in games.
As the name suggests, the balancing with this method is purely mathematical, meaning
that the behavior of the enemy remains the same while its stats such as the damage
dealt, the attack speed or even its health and defense are increased. This is a relatively
easy and rather time efficient way of balancing combat, as it only requires a change of
the different stat values and does not require any more design thinking or additional
iteration in design or programming. The main challenge for the player lies in gaining
the ability to “read“ the opponent, learn its pattern and react accordingly. Adjusting the
different settings results in the following challenges for the player:
• Increased Damage ultimately results in the player dying quicker when hit. So
the main objective for the player will be to evade the attacks of their opponent.
Making hits more unforgiving results in players becoming more cautious with their
actions, which at best results in tactical alternation of defensive and aggressive
behavior.
• Higher attack speed or quicker actions of the virtual character in general will in
return demand for higher reflexes of the player in order to be able to evade attacks
and land a blow. If smartly paired with increased damage, higher attack speed will
result in an especially tough challenge for the player.
• Enhanced health and defense will result in the fight becoming longer due to
the endurance of the virtual opponent. Usually, the more important and tougher
encounters such as bosses or mini-bosses will also have significantly more health-
points than “normal“ encounters that are scattered everywhere in the world.
40
4.1. Presentation of the Practical Execution
The longer the fight lasts, the more endurance is required from a player . Of
course, a longer fight doesn’t automatically make it more challenging, so increasing
an opponent’s health and defense should be done in combination with increasing
at least one of the first two stats mentioned, if possible.
Clearly, using the mathematical approach will lead to increased stats but will not change
the behavior of the opponent. Hence, it is heavily tied with the aspect of learning, so
the replay value in this case stems from the fact that the player has to learn the pattern
of the enemy and form a plan on how to react in every given situation. The satisfaction
of the player stems from the superiority due to tactical knowledge and being able to
predict a move. This approach has proven to be highly efficient and is oftentimes used
when creating varied difficulty settings for a game.
Figure 4.1.: How the different difficulty settings affect the stats and rewards of ene-
mies in Diablo 3 - Reaper of Souls (diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Difficulty)
Balancing difficulty by using behavioral variety
Typically, the alternation of the behavior of an enemy is mostly used in boss encounters
or other significant encounters and would not normally appear among smaller monsters
and enemies. In comparison to the mathematical approach, it is costlier to implement,
as it requires more design thinking, programmatic effort as well as testing for issues.
In case of larger enemy encounters, shifts in the behavior will mostly consist of different
41
4. Conducting a Field Test to evaluate the Replay Value of Combat
Balancing Methods
“phases“, triggered after a certain event that is usually linked to the progress of the
fight. This event could either be the enemy dropping to a certain amount of hit points,
killing off other smaller enemies in the area, pulling levers or destroying something in the
environment etc. The phases typically manifest in the form of alternate attack patterns
or the enhancement of a previous move pool by e.g. increasing the size of the hit boxes.
Switching the behavior of an enemy will serve as a kind of reset for the fight in terms
of learning patterns and therefore its unpredictability, which is why this approach is
mostly linked to the aspect of variety and adaption to the different circumstances rather
than the typical learning aspect that the mathematical approach is addressed. When
implemented correctly, alternating the behavior and move pool by assigning probabilities
to different moves will even result in the enemy having no distinguishable fighting pattern
at all.
Limiting the aspects to be investigated in order to increase the
replay value
As already mentioned in the description of the balancing methods, the prototype focuses
on increasing the difficulty on the one hand by increasing values and adjusting behavior
patterns on the other hand.
The difficulty of the player in the mathematical approach stems mainly from the fact
that the player has to try to take as little damage as possible. He achieves this only if he
can counteract the opponent’s behavior as well as possible, for example by avoiding the
opponent’s attacks. The challenge in this case is to be able to read the opponent and
to recognize their behavior patterns. In this case the aspect of learning is the primary
objective.
The behavioral approach on the other hand plays a lot with the unpredictability of the
opponent’s behavior. In this approach, the player has to adapt to the opponent again
and again by constantly adjusting his behavior and behavioral patterns. So the challenge
in this case is not to read the opponent and learn their behavior, but rather to be able
to adapt to different, sometimes randomly driven, behavior patterns. This approach
therefore applies to the Variety and Randomness aspect of replayability.
The other three aspects that can contribute to increasing the replay value of a game are
not investigated in detail over the course of this field test.
42
4.1. Presentation of the Practical Execution
The Social Aspect of the game seems particularly inappropriate for this study because
it is a single player mode.
The goal to increase the replay value with simple game
design mechanics and graphical means is also in contrast to the motivation by creating
a memorable Experience or even Nostalgia.
Goals and Completion also seem less interesting due to decision to use the simplest
possible game mechanics. While the player’s goal is to defeat the enemy of each difficulty
level, this motivation is intrinsic, meaning it comes from the player themselves, rather
than goals set by the game. The player does not receive rewards in the form of items,
nor are score points or other scoring features provided. Although a prototype could
possibly be adapted to provide such goals for the player, this would possibly distort the
result of the test, making this aspect seem rather insignificant and of little interest for
the study.
4.1.2. Procedure of the practical field test
In the field study conducted in this thesis, the aim is to investigate the subjects’ or
players’ reactions and thoughts about the experienced difficulty and their willingness
to replay a game based on one of two prototypes consisting of a simple game scene
featuring combat between a player character and an artificial opponent. The provided
prototype uses either a mathematical or a behavioral approach to gradually increase the
difficulty of the fight.
The goal of this study is to find out whether or not difficulty achieved by a pure behavioral
approach can provide replay value to a game and if it is competitively viable compared
to the often used mathematical approach. In a follow up questionnaire the players will
be asked to assess the replay value of the respective balancing technique in regards to a
whole game being balanced this way or a game providing three different difficulty settings
based on those techniques. Additionally, players will be asked to give their thoughts on
meta artificial intelligence and adaptive difficulty settings.
Structure of the Prototypes
Each prototoype features three 3D scenes including a controllable player character and a
virtual opponent steered by the artificial intelligence. The first scenes of each prototype
are identical and lay the foundation for the survey. In the following scenes however, the

difficulty is raised using mathematical adjustments on one and behavioral adjustments
on the other prototype as portrayed in table 4.1. Both prototype’s artificial intelligence
are implemented using behavior trees as described in chapter 3.1.2. This technique has
proven to be efficient and well used throughout many games of the role-playing and
action role-playing genre, which is why this implementation technique was chosen to be
the foundation for this field study.
As combat and the implementation of the artificial intelligence is the main focus of the
prototypes, they only contain very basic game design mechanics. Therefore, the move
pool for the player and the virtual opponent will be limited to a set of basic actions:
• Horizontal Movement
• Dodge-roll
• 3-Hit Combo with a 30% chance of stunning the target with a successful hit
Additionally, the player will be able to mark the opponent as a target in order to be able
to lock the camera.
Graphics wise, the prototypes only use geometric shapes and simple human models and
44
4.1. Presentation of the Practical Execution
animations for the characters as well as little to no special effects or sounds. Likewise,
the level design of the stage is kept very primitive and consists of a square shaped stage
with walls around so that neither the virtual opponent nor the player can fall off the
stage. This level structure is the same for all stages across both prototypes.
Everything concerning loot and rewards for the player will be disregarded for the purpose
of the study. The incentive for the player to re-battle the opponent should be the fun in
the fight and combat, not the desired reward.
Conduction of the field test
The goal of the study is to examine and compare the replay value of the two prototypes.
Since the replay value of both of them is based on their difficulty and - especially
the mathematically balanced prototype - the learning aspect, it would diminish the
significance of the results when letting the subjects play each prototype. Therefore,
test subjects are divided into two equal groups with each group playing only one of the
two prototypes.
In order to find suitable test subjects, volunteers are asked to fill out a questionnaire
(see appendix A). This questionnaire consists of questions about their usual gaming as
well as replay habits. Among others, this includes questions such as the preferred game
genres and titles as well as overall importance of different factors such as graphics and
content.
These questions are intended to aid in categorizing the test subjects so that the two
prototypes can be distributed as evenly as possible among the different types of players.
In order to be able to draw conclusions in regards to possible target groups and general
characteristics of the players, test subjects are asked to provide a password or token in
order to be able to match answers from the initial and the follow-up questionnaire as
well as recorded testing data.
After the test persons have been divided into groups, they are each sent one of the
two prototypes. They are then asked to play the prototype for as long as they want and
feel entertained. While playing, data about the respective player behavior is generated
and stored. This includes the duration of the overall playtime as well as the time spent in
each stage. Additionally, the number of deaths and replays of the individual scenes will
be analysed. After playing, the subjects are asked to fill out a follow-up questionnaire
45
4. Conducting a Field Test to evaluate the Replay Value of Combat
Balancing Methods
(see appendix B). Subsequently, the filled in questionnaire together with the collected
data is sent back to the author for evaluation.
4.2. Implementation of the Practical Test
The technical implementation of the two prototypes is done using the game development
engine Unity. The programming language used is C#. In addition, changes and progress
during implementation and development were stored in a repository using the versioning
tool GitLab.
Assets used from the Unity Asset Store
The prototypes are supposed to consist of simple game mechanics and simple graphical
elements. Despite this apparent simplicity, there are a lot of components that play a
part when creating a combat situation that feels good to the player. Especially the
implementation of a smooth-feeling character controller is already anything but trivial.
In addition to this came the requirements of an artificial intelligence as well as a combat
system through which the player and opponent can interact with each other.
Since implementing these features from scratch would exceed the scope of the bachelor
thesis’ time frame, ready-made assets from Unity’s asset store are used where possible.
In the case of the character controllers and a combat system, the chosen asset is the
“Third Person Controller - Melee Combat Template“ from Invector1. This asset provides
most of the functionality needed for the prototypes: for the player character this means
horizontal movement, an attack combo as well as a dodge roll and the lock-on function
for targeting enemies.
The asset also provides additional movement functionalities such as jumping or sprinting.
Also, with regard to the combat system provided, the asset offers further functionality
such as heavy attacks, blocking as well as a stamina and inventory system. However,
as described in chapter 4.1.2, the combat is supposed to be rather simple in order to
better determine whether or not a game can have replay value with an elemental combat

system. That is why these additional functions were disabled for the prototype.
In addition, Invector’s asset also provides functionalities for simple artificial intelligence.
These include both a companion system and simple melee opponents that can be used as
simple enemies or even bosses and can be tested in a demo level. All variables relevant
to players or virtual characters, such as health points, damage, speed, etc., can be
easily adjusted via the Unity inspector. However, in order to have more control over the
behavior of the artificial intelligence, the “Behavior Designer“ asset from Opsive2 was
used instead of solely relying on the provided scripts.
This asset provides the possibility to easily create artificial intelligence behavior in the
same fashion as described in chapter 3.1.2. The behavior trees can be modelled with
the use of an easy to handle graphical user interface and thereafter stored as external
instances which can then simultaneously be used on various prefabs. Additionally, the
tool can be fully customized as Tasks can be added by simply inheriting from the Action
or Conditional classes.

Structure and implementation of artificial intelligence behavior
for the prototype
The tree-like structure, as well as the flexibility and simplicity of adapting the tree and
the visual feedback of the nodes3, make the Behavior Designer a comparatively simple
way to realize the behavior of virtual characters. Furthermore, the graphical interface
provides an easy way to trace steps of the AI at run-time and debug possible erroneous
behavior.
In the case of the prototypes developed within the bachelor thesis, the script for con-
trolling simple melee enemies from the Invector asset was split into individual tasks
that inherited either from the action or conditional classes. Afterwards, the behavior
of Invector’s simple melee opponent was remodelled within the tree structure of the
Behavior Designer. After finishing this process, the thereby created behavior tree was
used for the behavior of the enemies in the mathematically balanced approach as well
as the first stage of the behaviorally balanced approach and lay the foundation for the
rest of the required opponents.
As for the mathematically balanced prototype, all that had to be done after creating
Figure 4.3.: Behavior tree used for the mathematical balancing prototype and as the
basis for the behavioral balancing prototype
3for example, a check mark at the node for Success or a red X for Failure, as well as the green
coloring of the currently executed nodes and paths within the tree, as can be seen in the graphic
4.2 at run-time
48
4.2. Implementation of the Practical Test
the basic behavior was to adjust the corresponding values of the opponents, such as
their health points, their damage dealt, and the time between attacks.
The behavior tree provides the possibility to add variables that can then be used to
create to alternate the behavior of different enemies even when they use the same
behavior tree. In the case of this prototype and the basic behavior, this comes down to
the time between individual attacks (here minimum and maximum value of the attack
delay) or between the reset of attacks and thus the restart of an attack combo (here
minimum and maximum value of the reset delay).
Both values are used within the color-coded Wait action seen in 4.3. The actual wait
time within the node is then randomized between the respective maximum and minimum
value. This randomization is used to at least partially provide a sense of unpredictability
even for the mathematical approach.
For the behaviorally balanced prototype, the “basic behavior tree“ had to be further
Figure 4.4.: Expansion of the basic behavior tree in 4.3 for second phase enemy (left)
and third phase enemy (right)
extended by several functions. The main difference between the second and first phase
is the alternation between defensive and aggressive behavior. As the state is relevant for
the behavior of the virtual character, this state has to be re-evaluated at the beginning
of each run of the Behavior Tree (see the marked red area in the top-left corner of the
left behavior tree in 4.4).
Whether or not the artificial intelligence is supposed to change between states is on the
one hand determined by how many behavior tree evaluations the virtual character has
already been within a certain state and on the other hand, how much damage was dealt
either to it or by it. The status mainly influences the behavior of the virtual character in
49

Balancing Methods
terms of using its attack or evading incoming attacks. Thus, an attack in the aggressive
state is much more likely than in the defensive state and likewise, the virtual character
is more likely to try to evade an attack by the player when in defensive mode.
The former is evaluated by using a conditional node before starting the attack cycle,
while the latter is determined within the TakeDamage function by the virtual character
as can be seen in 4.5.
For the third phase, the opponent is also given the ability to quickly close in on the

probability for the evasion is dependent on the current state of the
virtual character and increases when in defensive state, while decreasing

player by dashing towards them, if the player initially was too far away to be attacked.
Additionally, both stage two and three opponents have the possibility to time their
attacks so that they are not starting an attack cycle if the player is currently rolling
and thereby evading attacks. Instead, the artificial intelligence waits for the player to
be done with the dodge roll, before starting the attack cycle. The areas of the behavior
tree marked in red in the 4.2 graphic show the respective differences or extensions to the
predecessor.
After the different enemy levels were ready and the behavior implementation was
done, a simple arena was created using ProBuilder. Afterwards, the respective scenes
were linked together. The prototype was then extended to include a “login screen“ using
the access token specified by the players. Furthermore, a distinction between the two
prototype approaches was added, as well as the functionality to save game data. The
saved game data includes the prototype played, the time within a scene, the order in
which scenes were played, and whether the player or the opponent won as can be seen
in the tables in appendix C.

In the end, both prototypes were combined within one build.
The distinction with
which prototype the player is confronted is made on the basis of the access token, which
they must enter in the login scene. This is followed by a short explanation of what awaits
the player in the following. Afterwards they can either start a test scene with dummies
to get to know the controls of the game or dive straight into combat and the respective
stages. After the death of either the opponent or the player, they can choose which
of the scenes to play next, though the next difficulty will only unlock once the player
managed to defeat the opponent.
4.3. Evaluation of the Practical Test
As part of the practical test, volunteers were initially asked to register as test subjects by
means of a questionnaire.
A total of 40 volunteers registered this way, which were
subsequently divided into two equal groups to test either the mathematical or the
behavioral prototype. After the playtest, they were asked to give feedback on it and
51

on the topic of meta artificial intelligence. This again happened in the form of a follow-
up questionnaire. Additionally, the test subjects were asked to submit a json file that
consisted of the data that was collected during playtime.
Regarding the test and follow-up questionnaire, a total of 33 responses and 31 game
data were collected and submitted. Of these, 17 answers referred to the mathematical
prototype and 16 answers to the behavioral prototype.
The registration questionnaire
A questionnaire was used to enroll the volunteers as test subjects for the practical test.
In addition to contact information, the questionnaire also contained general questions
about gaming preferences and their classic gaming behavior.
The result showed that the role-playing genre is the most popular genre among the test
Figure 4.7.: Comparison of the usual time needed to complete a game in comparison
with the time actually spent playing these games
subjects with a total of 77.5% of the votes. This was followed by the adventure genre
(42.5%), real-time strategy (35%), shooter (30%) and survival (27.5%).
The average playing time to complete a normal story or campaign mode or a game
round was between 28.6 and 40.3 hours. The most frequently mentioned game times
were between 30 and 50 game hours or 1 and 5 hours. Still, there was an obvious
willingness to spend more game time beyond the completion of such a mode or round.
Nearly 50% stated, they spend an average of more than 100 hours in total playing their
favorite games. On the whole, this results in a playing time of about 67.25 to 77.25
hours or more, which is about twice the playing time of the initially stated average time
it takes to finish the respective title.
52
4.3. Evaluation of the Practical Test
The willingness to play and replay a game for a longer period of time is also reflected
in the next question: only 5% of respondents indicated that they had never replayed a
game. More than 75%, on the other hand, stated that they had already played through
a game again, a further 7.5% had repeated at least parts or chapters of a game, while
the remaining 10% had at least once begun to play a game again.
In this context, it was not at all important what the genre composition or expected
playing time of the respective games were. From games with comparatively short rounds
like Age of Empires or even Osu to games with long story campaigns like The Witcher
3, Dragon Age, Final Fantasy or Gothic pretty much everything was mentioned.
As seen in 4.8, the main motivations for replaying are to re-experience a story or
Figure 4.8.: Reasons for replaying a game including classification into the six cate-
gories mentioned in chapter 2.2
at least certain parts of it. This also includes experiencing other resulting plotlines that
are achieved through different actions and decisions. Players also selected trying out
different builds or play styles as a particular incentive to replay a game.
Considering the most frequently chosen motivations, the following ranking of the reasons
for replaying mentioned in chapter 2.2 emerges:
1. Variety and Randomness
2. Experience and Nostalgia
3. Goals and Completion
4. Social Aspect
5. Difficulty
53

6. Learning
The most important factors for choosing which game to play were as much content as
possible to explore as well as fluid and intuitive controls that can be adjusted to the
players needs. In terms of playing time, the test subjects predominantly preferred longer,
compelling campaign modes and stories to shorter (round-based) games.
Evaluation of the prototypes and the follow-up questionnaire
As already mentioned, the 40 subjects who agreed to be voluntary testers of the proto-
types were separated into two even groups of 20 testers each. One group was then given
access to the mathematical prototype, the other to the behaviorally balanced prototype.
Although the opinions of the subjects overlapped and were similar on many questions
regarding both prototypes, significant differences between the results could be observed.
One of the first of these differences was the perceived difficulty of each challenge level, as
well as the overall impression of the prototype. As can be seen in graph 4.9, the results
for the first difficulty level were almost identical. But already from level two on, clear
differences regarding the difficulty could be observed: where the behavioral approach
was still rated as easy, the general opinion towards the mathematical approach already
went into the assessment “difficult“ or even “too difficult“.
This discrepancy intensified even further towards the third level of difficulty. While almost
50% of the respondents rated the mathematical approach as “much too difficult“, the
opinions on the behavioral approach were dominated by “somewhat too easy“ (56.3%)
and “much too easy“ (31.3%).
In terms of overall difficulty, the mathematical prototype scored significantly better
than the behavioral prototype. The former was rated with slightly more than 1/3 as
“just right“ and slightly more than 50% as “a little too hard“, whereas the behavioral
approach was almost consistently rated as “a little too easy“ (43.8%) or even “much too
easy“ (50%).
When conducting the feedback, the major difficulties within the mathematical approach
were mostly due to the controls and the perception of the controls as “too clunky“. For
example, players of the mathematical approach were significantly more likely to want
options such as animation canceling, a lower player response time to input, and a larger
moveset of ways to engage in combat. In comparison, the feedback of the behavioral
54
4.3. Evaluation of the Practical Test
Figure 4.9.: Comparison of the perceived difficulty of the two prototypes in terms of
overall challenge as well as difficulty per challenge level
approach was mainly about game design suggestions on how to improve and strengthen
the opponent. It was not uncommon for mathematical approaches such as higher damage
or health points to be referenced within those suggestions.
This perception of difficulty is also reflected in the recorded game data (see appendix
C). In the behavioral approach, almost all players were able to defeat the opponent
within the first encounter at all three challenge levels, whereas the number of attempts
to defeat the opponent of the same challenge rating in the mathematical approach
increased significantly. Already at the second level the number of attempts needed to
succeed was 2.78, which increased again to 23.25 attempts needed to succeed at level
3. Comparing the two with one another, the attempt for clearing the third level is about
8 times as many attempts as at level two.
It is especially important to note that only a total of 8 out of 15 individuals whose
data could be analyzed were able to successfully pass the third stage, which is only
slightly more than 50%. The average number of attempts of those who gave up was
about 13.8 attempts.
Due to this significantly higher number of trials that led to success with the mathematical
approach, the average time required to play the prototype was almost three times higher
than with the behavioral approach. Of course, it would be possible to end the study
and conclude that the mathematical approach is better than the behavioral approach in
terms of the quality of a game in terms of the cost-value ratio. However, the data and
answers obtained show significantly opposite results with regard to the replay value and
the willingness to spend more time with a game.

As can be seen in the table 4.2, the behavioral approach was repeated by significantly
more people after successfully completing each stage compared to the mathematical ap-
proach. Also, the actual number of replays beyond the completed attempt is significantly
higher on a percentage basis for the behavioral approach.
Considering the results of the follow-up questionnaire with regard to playing behavior
and the probability of replaying a game modeled after the respective prototype, similar
findings emerge as those obtained from the game data. In these questions, players were
asked to imagine the previously played prototype as a finished game.
Subsequently,
subjects were asked about factors such as their likeliness for purchasing the game and
their probable play behavior.
Figure 4.10.: Comparison of the testsubjects’ rating for the probability to buy a
game that is balanced similar to the previously played prototype
The same questions were asked twice.
The difference was that in the first round
of questions the respondents were asked to imagine the increase in challenge of the
56
4.3. Evaluation of the Practical Test
prototype as a progressive increase in challenge within the course of a game, whereas
the second round of questions referred to three different levels of challenge (normal,
difficult, pro) between which the players could choose.
As for the question about the probability of purchasing such a game, the behavioral ap-
proach with progressive difficulty increase was found to be the most attractive prototype
for buying the game. With the mathematical approach, a game with fixed, adjustable
difficulties enjoys a significantly higher popularity than the progressive difficulty increase.
One reason for this may be that especially the difficulty curve between the second and
third level turned out to be too difficult and extreme for most players. In the example
with different difficulty modes, players at least have the option to choose what kind of
challenge they want to be confronted with.
Figure 4.11.: Comparison of the testsubjects’ rating for the probability to finish a
story or campaign of a game that is balanced similar to the previously
played prototype
The behavioral approach with progressive difficulty increase also clearly surpassed the
other options when it comes to the question of how likely players are to complete the
respective game (see figure 4.11) if it is already in their possession, as well as the
probability of continuing to play it or replaying the game after the game has ended (see
figure 4.12).
For the majority, the expected playing time that the game would provide was rather
57
4. Conducting a Field Test to evaluate the Replay Value of Combat
Balancing Methods
Figure 4.12.: Comparison of the testsubjects’ rating for the probability to replay a
game that is balanced similar to the previously played prototype
unimportant. However, with regard to the money that the test persons would be willing
to spend for the respective game, a significantly higher price classification was made for
the progressive difficulty increase with behavioral balancing than with the others.
For a game like that, almost 40% indicated a willingness to spend a price of 40-60€.
In the mathematical approach with progressive difficulty increase, on the other hand,
the amount of money spent was equally divided between 10 and 19€ and 20 and 29€,
and thus only about half of the price indicated in the behavioral approach. Even for the
three difficulty levels, at least 1/4 of the respondents would be willing to spend 40-60€
for the game that provides behavioral balancing, whereas for the mathematical share the
distribution is relatively similar to the progressive difficulty increase.
As for the genre of the respective game, as seen in B.2.2 and B.3.2, in all four examples
the Role-Playing Game genre was very much up front as the preferred game type. In the
mathematical prototype with three difficulty levels, the genre received a commitment
of almost 65%. In the progressive difficulty increase, the Rogue-Like genre was also
strongly represented with about 20% each. In the behavioral approach, the progressive
prototype and especially the prototype based on three difficulty levels also showed a clear
tendency towards the adventure genre (18.8% and 43.8%, respectively).
For the majority, the most crucial factor for the purchase was a unique game mechanic or
a unique combination of different game mechanics. The feedback regarding the changes
to the difficulties and the improvement of the prototype to a game that appeals to
the test persons, covered several suggestions regarding the game design in terms of the
58
4.3. Evaluation of the Practical Test
mechanics provided for the player and the optimization of the controls. Above all, more
possibilities for development within the game were desired. Regarding movement and
combat mechanics, the following mechanics emerged:
• more control over the player character in terms of canceling attacks or dodge rolls
(Animation Cancel)
• Variety of movement and attack options: light and heavy attacks, special abilities,
holding the attack button for a heavy charged, jumping, dodging backwards
• Ability to block or parry attacks, instead of just the dodge roll
• visual and auditory feedback within the fight
Considering such feedback, it is apparent that while the design of the combat and the
variance of the enemies is significantly important to the longevity of a game, ultimately
the game design and the interplay of the world, mechanics, and the virtual characters
are significantly more crucial and important to the continued enjoyment and retention
of the players in the game and the experience gained from it.
Meta Artificial Intelligence
In addition to feedback on the respective prototype and the data collected through it,
the subjects were given a brief introduction and explanation of the concept of “Meta
Artificial Intelligence“ at the end of the questionnaire. Subsequently, they were asked
opinions and judgments on the topic.
The first questions initially related to the general attitude to the topic. Already 54.5% of
the respondents stated that they had heard the term “Meta Artificial Intelligence“ or even
played a game that supports and uses this technology. Initial attitudes toward the topic
of adaptive difficulty adjustments were relatively evenly split, but leaned more heavily
toward more players wanting this type of balancing in games as can be seen in B.4.3.
Similar results were obtained when subjects were asked about their views on the general
use of artificial intelligence to create individual games or gaming experiences. This was
not only about adaptive difficulty adjustment, but also procedural content generation
and technologies that can be used to individualize content.
Regarding the purchase motivation, a majority of the respondents stated that they
59
4. Conducting a Field Test to evaluate the Replay Value of Combat
Balancing Methods
would very probably want to buy a game with adaptive difficulty.
Only 5 votes of
the respondents settled in the ranges of “rather unlikely“ to “very unlikely“ . Most of the
test subjects (42.2%) wanted a price of up to 29€. A little more than 1/5 would even
be willing to spend between 40 and 60€ for such a game and thus a more individual
gaming experience.
With regard to gameplay behavior, most indicated that they would at least play through
and finish a game with adaptive difficulty balancing, but when asked whether players
would play through such a game again, the distribution of probability was much more
distributed and settled mainly in a kind of neutral agreement between “likely“ and “un-
likely“ as can be seen in B.4.8.
This division is also reflected in the general opinion and feedback on the topic of
meta artificial intelligence: although many would like to have a more individual game
experience, it still requires certain limits in terms of the difficulty range in which the
game then varies.
Particularly on the topic of the survival genre, there were many concerns that a meta
artificial intelligence could create a sense of “unfairness“. Major concerns regarding this
genre were that survival games would destroy the incentive to prepare, as this could be
counteracted by the meta artificial intelligence, which would effectively penalize “good
play“.
Similarly, in the field of fighting and strategy games, concerns have been expressed
that the appeal of the game comes from the same basic requirements of the competing
parties. The challenge in this type of game is to use one’s own skills better than the
opponent. If one of the two parties (for example the computer) would get an advantage
by a superior instance, then it rather gets the same bad taste as being cheated on, as is
the case with “rubber-banding“ instances that are often used in racing games.
Other major concerns are expressed about whether opponents could be tricked and
manipulated more strongly than is already the case in a lot of video games. On the other
hand, people are likewise concerned, that the increase in difficulty would be too strong
to make the game playable for the player. Here again, there is a plea for a limitation of
the meta artificial intelligence or the possibility to turn adaptive challenge adjustments
off completely and to be able to manually choose a level of difficulty instead.

5. Summary and Conclusion
The research field of artificial intelligence has made massive technological progress over
the past 30 years [BKT14, p. 534]. This is also evident in terms of its development in the
field of video games: previously “newest “ and “most realistic “ graphics and other visual
enhancements played a large part in the marketing strategy of many games. Nowadays,
those aims to create better graphics have lead to the possibility to create more and
better artificial intelligence for games [Sch09, p. 6].
The term “intelligence“ describes the ability to acquire knowledge and the ability to
utilize it in a variety of contexts [Sch09, p. 2]. The term “artificial intelligence“, on
the other hand, describes the modeling of such intelligence. Human intelligence usually
serves as a model for this.
How this intelligence is achieved is usually irrelevant. More important is the result. Thus,
models such as “Behavior Trees“ or “State Machines“ are technically not considered
artificial intelligence according to the actual definition, but are nevertheless referred to
as such in mainstream gaming [YT18, p. 7].
Artificial intelligence is used in many areas of the gaming industry today. Probably the
most obvious example is virtual characters such as opponents, companions or other non-
playable characters. Here, artificial intelligence mainly refers to the behavior modeling
of such a character, which can also include pathfinding algorithms or intelligent dialog
systems, among others. Artificial intelligence can be used to make battles more exciting,
for example by having opponents follow certain strategies and tactics, or by having a
horde of opponents organize themselves as a group and act tactically smart.
Other technologies such as meta artificial intelligence further enable the difficulty within
a game to be manipulated at runtime and customized to suit the player’s ability level in
order to preserve the feeling of “Flow“ [Csi14, p. 136-137] (see chapter 3.2 for further
detail). However, the fields of content generation, auto play-testing and other areas
of development are also becoming more and more common research fields for artificial
intelligence.

5. Summary and Conclusion
Due to the multitude of possible applications, including content generation, the indi-
vidualization of the gaming experience and the adjustment of difficulty levels, artificial
intelligence can also contribute to significantly increasing the duration of a game or even
its replay value and thus the longevity of a game.
The reasons for replaying a game are numerous, but can mostly be assigned to one
of the following six categories:
• Experience or Nostaliga
• Goals and Completion
• Social Aspect
• Variety and Randomnesss
• Difficulty
• Learning
[FGLS11, p. 20-21][Kos13, p. 38-42] In games with a combat focus and the corre-
sponding design of the opponent behavior, the replay value of a game can be increased
by the correct use of artificial intelligence. This is especially the case in the previously
mentioned categories of Difficulty, Learning as well as Variety and Randomness.
Increasing the replay value in these areas is especially relevant to the genre of action role-
playing games. The genre is based on the concept of an adventure or a hero’s journey
with a primary focus on real-time combat, in which skill checks regarding the game
mechanics in combination with the player’s quick reflexes and hand-eye coordination are
required. In most cases, there are many different types of enemies within this genre with
various behavioral patterns and abilities. These can be small, “light opponents“ as well
as large boss monsters [Wri20][Sch09, p. 73].
In this bachelor thesis, two typical balancing approaches for the opponent difficulty
of this genre were modeled and subsequently analyzed: a mathematical and a behavioral
approach.
On the game design side, the resulting prototypes were based on simple
mechanics. These consisted of
• horizontal Movement
62
• camera rotation and lock-on function to target opponents
• three hit combo
• dodge roll
• 30% chance to stun the opponent for a short time after a successful attack
In addition, an opponent was designed using behavior trees, which was balanced using one
of two approaches. Specifically, a mathematical approach with a simple increase of values
such as health points or damage dealt and a behavioral approach where the behavior
of the opponent is adjusted with increasing difficulty and made more unpredictable by
adding variance1 as well as making the opponent’s decisions overall smarter.
In the mathematical approach, the main challenge is to analyze and learn the opponent’s
behavior in order to respond to them in a faster and more efficient way. In the behavioral
approach, on the other hand, the difficulty comes from the ongoing variance and, if
necessary, randomization of the opponent’s behavioral patterns. Thus, the challenge
in this approach stems from the fact that the player has to permanently adapt to the
opponent’s changing behavior. If opponents now also adapt their tactical behavior in
order to be able to react better to the player, this creates a dynamic that cognitively
challenges the player throughout the entire battle, instead of providing the possibility to
rely on mere memorization.
Based on the analysis of the prototypes in connection with their attractiveness in terms of
purchase motivation, motivation to play-through, and their replay value, the behavioral
approach was predominantly shown to be superior to the mathematical approach. How-
ever, since mere behavioral adjustment was considered too easy in terms of difficulty, it
is advisable to rely on a mixture of both methods. In addition, the written feedback and
comments of the test subjects showed that a certain degree of predictability is welcome
from time to time and not a bad thing as it also prevents players from burning out
quickly [Sch09, p. 37-38].
In conclusion, it can thus be said that the use of artificial intelligence within the gaming
sector will increase in the future. This may also involve an interplay of many different
implementation strategies.
Behavior trees and state machines, have proven to not
necessarily be worse than other implementation strategies when done correctly. However,
1for more details see the chapter 4.1

5. Summary and Conclusion
other technologies, such as decision making, meta artificial intelligence or instances, can
be used to further improve the performance of the virtual characters or the game world in
general. When focusing on combat artificial intelligence, the main focus should be on a
variance in enemy behavior, though developers can also rely on the classic mathematical
way when balancing the opponents’ strength.

B. Prototype Test Follow-up Questionnaire
This questionnaire was filled out by the test subjects after playing one of the two pro-
totypes (either mathematically or behaviorally balanced one). The information provided
here consists of the results of the questionnaire that was taken after the initial play test.
The results regarding questions about the respective prototype are separated between
the answers to the mathematical approach (on the left) and the behavioral approach (on
the right).
The results for the questions regarding Meta Artificial Intelligence however, are the
combined answers of all participants.
A total of 33 responses were submitted, of which 17 related to the mathematical
prototype and 16 to the behavioral prototype.
The questions were translated into English to keep the language of this paper consistent.
Written responses, on the other hand, were not translated in order not to distort the
statements and thoughts of the respective respondent.

B.1.1. How appropriate did you perceive the overall difficulty of
the prototype you tested?
B.1.2. What did you consider to be the most challenging aspect
of the prototype in terms of difficulty? (also feel free to
elaborate on the individual difficulty levels)
Answers for the mathematical prototype
• Die Steuerung war nicht “flüssig“ genug. Ich habe vor kurzem Final Fantasy 7
Remake gespielt. Die Ausweichrolle war meiner Meinung nach zu verzögert von
Druck des Knopfes bis zur Ausführung. Es fehlt eine Option zum Blocken oder
gar parieren. Vorallem auf die 3. Stage bezogen ist es einfach unfair wenn dich ein
Gegner mit 2 Schlägen töten kann. Du dich aber nicht heilen kannst oder mit einer
Aktion (parrieren genau in der Sekunde in der er angreift z.B.) etwas dagegen tun
kannst. Vielleicht wäre eine Unverwundbarkeit während der Ausweichrolle ebenfalls
eine Lösung. Außerdem hat sich der Gegner nicht von den Attacken beeinflussen
lassen ( damit meine ich speziell eine Attacke abbrechen wenn er getroffen wird).
So war es vorallem in Stage 3 fast unmöglich den Gegner anzugreifen ohne dass er
dich auch trifft. Bei dem Schadensoutput macht dies das Level nicht schafftbar.
(für mich)
• - Kein Abbruch (Cancel´n) der Angriffsanimation durch Ausweichen (allgemein)
-Allgemein die Steuerung ist nicht Intuitiv (anvisieren auf Tab ???, Blocken nach
A20
B.1. General Questions regarding the Prototype
hinten drücken ???) - zu langsamer, träger Input (zu behebig, wenig flüssig) -
fehlendes Treffer Feedback, sowohl visuel als akustisch ( gefühl von Luft schlagen)
- letzte Schwierigkeitsstufe unausgewogen in Hinblick auf Leben und Reaktionzeit
der KI, obwohl Verhalten und Bewegungsmuster ähnlich Simpel ausfallen wie in
den lvorran gegangenen Leveln - im dritten Level wurde man zuschnell bestraft
sobald man ein Angriff startet (Gefühlt Sofort Konter von der KI wenn man nur
daran denkt angreifen zuwollen) - fehlendes Ausdauer Managment der KI (keine
Zeitfenster um selbst zu Kontern) - kein Estus Flakon ;)
• der Sprung von 2 zu 3 war sehr extrem. 2 war first oder second try (kann mich nicht
mehr ganz erinnern) 3 habe ich maximal bis etwas unter die Hälfte seines Lebens
geschafft, bei vllt 10-20 Versuchen. Den Schaden des dritten Gegners habe ich als
viel zu hoch empfunden. Ich war zwar durchaus ehrgeizig und wollte ihn besiegen,
aber aufgrund der etwas clunky Steuerung habe ich dann die Geduld verloren. Es
hat sich aber schon schaffbar angefühlt, nur war das Spiel eben nicht belohnend
genug, es lange genug zu versuchen bis es klappt. Klar ist es im Rahmen der BA
nicht erwartbar, dass die Mechaniken super gepolisht sind, aber für nicht-Souls-
like-Spieler wie mich wären es besser gewesen, wenn der Charakter etwas schneller
auf Inputs reagiert hätte).
• Die Schwierigkeit hat von Stage 2 zu 3 zu stark angezogen. Fände es da etwas
smoother vielleicht besser. An sich gefällt mir dieses 2 Hit KO Thema. Hat was
von den Souls spielen. Für so einen Schwierigkeitsgrad muss dann aber auch das
“gameplay“ stimmen. Mir ist bewusst, dass das in so einem kleinen Test nicht
realisierbar ist, aber auf so einem Schwierigkeitsgrad ist sowas wie Timing (rolle
kam super verspätet wenn man gedrückt hat oder garnicht) und flüssiges Spiel
(Animation cancelling, hit box) wichtig. Wenn man da optimiert denke ich hat
das schon richtig Potential.
• Die Unsicherheit in der Registrierung meiner Tasteneingaben kombiniert mit meiner
Ungeduldigkeit. Ich muss dabei natürlich berücksichtigen, dass meine Hardware
mit die Schuld dabei tragen könnte.
Beim testen des 3 Stages ist mir aufge-
fallen das beim laufen nicht immer mein Klicken zum Angriff registriert wurde.
Oder es speicherte meine mehreren panischen Klicks, dass ich in der Kombo fest
steckte und nicht ausweichen konnte. Nach mehreren Versuchen in Stage 3 ist
das frustrierende klicken und tippen immer zum Verhängniss geworden.
A21
B. Prototype Test Follow-up Questionnaire
• Die Agilität: Nicht in der Lage zu sein die Ausweichrolle zu verwenden, während
man sich noch in der Angriffsanimation befindet, stellte für mich die häufigste
Todesursache dar. Da der Gegner mich auch treffen kann während ich mich in der
ersten Angriffsanimation befinde, muss man (explizit in Stufe 3) eher raten, ob der
Gegner einen Gegenangriff triggert oder nicht. Sobald man die Angriffsanimation
des Gegners sieht ist man meistens bereits nicht mehr in der Lage seinen Angriff
abzubrechen.
• Ich fand, das der Kampf etwas unresponsive war. Das hat sich für mich darin
gezeigt, dass ein normaler Angriff eine sehr lange Animation hat und die Möglichkeit
des Ausweichens langzeitig blockt (ca 3 sec). Dadurch war es sehr schwer Angriffen
auszuweichen, da ich nicht auf gegnerische Angriffe reagieren konnte, sondern
lernen musst, wann die KI angreifen wird, damit ich vor so einem Moment keinen
eigenen Angriff starte.
• Während man selbst angreift oder nach einem Dodge kann der Gegner als Teil
einer Attack-Combo (vorallem im 3. Level) viel Schaden machen, den man relativ
schwer vermeiden kann. Dies motiviert auch etwas dazu, eher defensiv zu spielen.
• Die Fähigkeit “Ausweichrolle“ reagierte oft zu langsam, was erfolgreiches Auswe-
ichen erschwerte (Timing) - v.a. bei den Schwierigkeitsstufen 2 und 3, da diese
Stufen durch den höheren Schaden der gegner weniger Fehler verzeihen.
• Attack Animation ging seeehr lang, Response auf Gegner Attacken war damit seehr
langsam Gegner hingegen konnte sehr schnell agieren, war auch nicht stunned von
treffern Außerdem sehr tanky in Level 3
• Die unpräzise Steuerung und manchmal unklaren Angriffe/Aktionen ohne Indika-
tor. Insb. in der dritten Stufe ist dies ein Hindernis, das zu unausweichlichen
Fehlversuchen führt.
• Stufe 1: Nichts Stufe 2: Die 3-Angriff-in-Folge-Combo Stufe 3: beim näheren
Umrunden des Gegners “teleportierte“ er sich Face Front zum Spieler und schlug
ihn dadurch
• Ihm auszuweichen war bei allen Stufen schwierig, weil man nur rollen und nicht
wie der Gegner seine Arme hoch machen konnte um zu blocken.
• träge Steuerung und zu viel schaden (als würde man mehrere Schwierigkeiten
überspringen und von leicht, sofort zu veteran springen)
A22
B.1. General Questions regarding the Prototype
• es war nicht schwer, hat sich auf Stufe 3 ’unfair’ und ’nervig’ angefühlt, mehr wie
eine Hausaufgabe, als ein Spiel
• Stufe 3: seeeehr viel damage und sehr schwer das timing richtig zu treffen Stufe
1 und 2 eher weniger schwer
• Nur 2 Hits im maximalen Grad sind zu wenig
Answers for the behavioral prototype
• Das schwierigste war, herauszufinden, wann der Gegner angreift und wann die
Rollen kommen. Man konnte recht gut vorraussehen, dass er abwehrt oder Angriffe
macht, wenn man nahe stand, aber nicht, wann diese erfolgen. Ein Unterschied
hierbei war der Stage 3 Bot.
Nachdem ich einmal nicht direkt auf ihn losge-
gangen bin entwickelte er folgendes Pattern: er ist bis auf einen kurzen Abstand
herangekommen.
Danach ist er auf Schwertlänge an mich herangetreten, hat
zugeschlagen und dann 2 Rollen von mir fortgemacht. Hier musste ich die Strategie
etwas anpassen, da er sich öfter von mir fort bewegt hat und ich hinterherrennen
musste.
• Stage1: Die Schwierigkeit hierbei lag meiner Meinung nach darin, die Angriffe des
Gegners durch nahes heranlaufen herauszulocken und dann während der Bot nicht
angreift zuzuschlagen. Stage 2: Hier kamen nun die zufälligen Bewegungen hinzu
und die Angriffe waren nicht mehr so leicht hervorzulocken. Jedoch konnte man
immernoch relativ gut die einzelnen Attacken hervorlocken und so den Gegner
austricksen. Stage 3: Durch die hinzukommenden Dodgerolls war es nun nicht
mehr möglich die Bewegungen des Gegners vorherzusagen und dies machte es
extrem schwer Zeitpunkte zu finden, in denen man ungestraft angreifen kann.
• Spielstufe 3 war anspruchsvoll unter der eigenen Herrausvorderung keinen Schaden
zu nehmen. Da die Hitbox des ersten Schlages sehr sehr früh einsetzt muss man
hierbei sehr stark aufpassen um nicht getroffen zu werden. Das der Gegner nach ein
paar schlägen direkt rollt und dem Spieler so die Möglichkeit einer Gegenattacke
nimmt ist recht gut.
• Die AI innerhalb ihrer Combos zu lesen, wenn sie sich vom Spieler abwendet.
Es vermittelt das Gefühl die AI folgt - anders als der Spieler - keinem Lock-On,
aber versucht dennoch den Spieler zu tracken, wobei man durchaus den ein oder
anderen “Seitenhieb“ einstecken muss.
A23
B. Prototype Test Follow-up Questionnaire
• Stage 1&2: Hier war kaum ein Unterschied zu bemerken in Hinsicht auf die
Schwierigkeit, daher würde ich sagen “wohin der Gegner läuft“ war schwierig
abzuschätzen. Stage 3: Abschätzen, wann er ausweicht und wann er angreift.
• auf allen Stufen: meine Angriffe richtig timen, sodass ich nicht selbst während
meiner Attacke angegriffen werde, es ist vergleichsweise schwer Schaden zu ver-
meiden sobald man angreift und Spam wird mehr belohnt als Taktik
• bis auf Stufe 3 war echt ez pz, erst beim dritten bin ich mit Linksklick Spam nicht
mehr weitergekommen. An dieser Stelle hat’s kurz gedauert herauszufinden, wie
er sich ungefähr verhält und wie ich darauf reagieren muss
• Stufe 1 empfand ich persönlich am schwierigsten, die durchgehenden angriffe
gaben keine gute möglichkeit zum gegenangriff wogegen ich bei den folgenden
schwierigkeitsstufen mehr das gefühl hatte
• Das Ausweichen in der letzten Stufe war besonders auffallend/schwer. Ansonsten
war die größte Herausforderung die eher träge Steuerung. Die ersten zwei Stages
waren sehr ähnlich.
• Dass der Charakter automatisch geblockt hat und das Angreifen unterbunden hat,
auch die Range vom gegnerischen Angriff war teilweise zu groß

B.1. General Questions regarding the Prototype
B.1.3. What did you consider to be the most easy aspect of the
prototype in terms of difficulty? (also feel free to
elaborate on the individual difficulty levels)
Answers for the mathematical prototype
• Die erste Stufe war recht leicht. Was nicht heißt, dass es “zu leicht“ war. Es sollte
in Spielen auch Gegner mit diesem Schwierigkeitsgrad geben damit Spieler einfach
ein Erfolgserlebnis bekommen können. Mir fällt zwar gerade nicht ein welches Spiel
es war aber ich habe mal ein Spiel gespielt indem es eine Gruppe aus Gegnern gab.
Die “normalen“ Gegner waren vergleichbar mit der KI von Stufe 1 und der “Boss“
der Gruppe mit der KI von Stufe 2. Durch töten von Gegnern hat man sich etwas
geheilt –> Einfache Gegner töten für die Heilung um es einfacher gegen den “Boss“
zu haben. Für ein 1:1 war Stufe 1 definitiv zu einfach.
• Aufgrund des leichten Vorwärts-Schritts beim Angriff kann man den Gegner umkreisen
und kontinuierlich angreifen und treffen, während man selbst durch diesen Schritt
immer sofort wieder aus der Attack-Range des Gegners raus ist. Mit dieser Meth-
ode kann man den Gegner relativ save besiegen, ohne selbst auch nur einmal
getroffen zu werden. Die “Challenge“ dabei ist hauptsächlich, den perfekten Radius
zu finden und einzuhalten. Anschließend wird der Kampf auch auf dem höchsten
Schwierigkeitsgrad ziemlich trivial.
• Die zweite Stufe hätte mehr Anreize geben können. Da war durch umkreisen des
Gegners sehr schnell die Methode gefunden den fertig zu machen. Da hätte die KI
eventuell besser reagieren können? Vielleicht wenn ein Gegner zu oft das gleiche
macht, dann dort entgegen wirken? Bei der dritten Stufe kam mir das so vor.
Sobald ich umkreist habe, hat er immer 2 Angriffe gemacht, was mich aus dem
Flow gebracht hat.
• Das blocken des Gegners in der 1 und 2 Stage ermöglichte es mehr Hits rein zu
bekommen. Da es die beiden Stages sind wo ich aggressiver in meinen Angriffen
war wurde er meines gefühls nach öfter in den Zustand versetzt. Ich weiß jedoch
nicht ob mein rücksichtsloses angreifen das hervor gebracht hat oder die KI das
random als Aktion vollzogen hat.
• - Unendliches Ausweichen und Angreifen (kein Ausdauer/Mana Managment) -
Auf den ersten beiden Schwierigkeitsstufen lässt sich die KI leicht mit schnell
A25
B. Prototype Test Follow-up Questionnaire
gelernten Bewegungsmustern (Pattern) überwinden z.B. stets nach links umkreisen
- Allgemein zu wenig Variation in den Abläufen der KI
• Stufe 1: Schaden des Prototypen Stufe 2: Wartezeiten zwischen den Angriffen
Stufe 3: Wartezeiten zwischen den Angriffen und, im Vergleich zum Spieler, war
keine Dodge Phase möglich
• Im ersten Level hat es ausgereicht, den Gegner durch Spammen des Angriffes
zu besiegen. Außerdem ist es einfach einem Angriff mithilfe einer Ausweichrolle
auszuweichen.
• Die Steuerung war sehr gut und auch die Schnelligkeit der Angriffe war nach meiner
Ansicht vollkommen angemessen und man konnte leicht den Gegner treffen.
• stage 1: als würde man gegen eine Puppe kämpfen, einfaches button smashen
ohne viel Bewegung hat komplett ausgereicht, um den Sieg davon zu tragen
• hmm da fällt mir gerade nichts zu ein. Die ersten Gegner waren relativ leicht, weil
sie verhältnismäßig wenig Schaden verursacht haben.
• Die KI ist nach etwas Spielzeit relativ gut zu durchschauen / vorhersehbar (sie
rennt zum Spieler, wenn dieser zu weit weg ist).
• Die Bewegungsgeschwindigkeit des Gegners könnte etwas höher sein.
• Level 1 und 2 waren mit sehr wenigen Schlägen zu besiegen
• manchmal konnte man die Gegner stun locken
• Gegner sehr predictable
• Erlernen des Spiels
Answers for the behavioral prototype
• Die AI lässt sich auch auf Stufe 3 aufgrund eines fehlenden Lock-Ons noch relativ
leicht “strafen“/umzirkeln. Wenn ab Stufe 2 die Dodge Roll dazu kommt, setz die
AI diese oft noch zu Zeitpunkten ein, bei denen es recht einfach ist diesen Move
zu punishen. Der Spieler kann ein Setup vollführen, indem er die dritte Instanz des
Schlages vorbereitet, um den Gegner nach Ablauf der Dodge Time zu staggern.
Als kleine Zusatzinformation dazu: Als ich die Stages mehrfach wiederholt habe,
A26
B.1. General Questions regarding the Prototype
habe ich diesen Ansatz getestet, da es ein ähnliches Spielgefühl zu den Soulsborne-
Titeln vermittelt hat und Spieler mit Erfahrung in diesem Feld es leichter haben
defensive Züge des Gegners gegen ihn zu kehren.
• Es ist schade, dass alle Gegner durch bloßes Schlagen spammen besiegt werden
können. Gerade Gegner 1 schlägt nicht so häufig. solange man oft genug schlägt
gewinnt man. Desweiteren können die Gegner gecheesed werden, wenn man mit
gelockter Kamera einfach nur nach rechts läuft und seine Distanz über vorne und
hinten leicht anpasst, kann man immer wieder aus dem Schlagtrigger Radius und
der gefährlichen Distanz rein und raus tänzeln. dadurch dass man nach rechts
läuft und der schlag auf der linken seite kommt trifft der Gegner kaum. Lediglich
die Rollen der dritten Stufe unterbrechen diese Strategie.
• Gewinnen. Auf jeder Schwierigkeitsstufe konnte man sich einfach vor den Geg-
ner stellen und die Angriffstaste spammen. Da der Bot zwischen Angreifen und
Parieren alterniert hat (und ich nicht) starb er eher als ich.
Ein Unterschied
dazu machte der Stage 3 Bot, der zudem immer 2 Rollen nach einem Angriff
eingeschoben hat. Aber auch hier war diese Strategie anwendbar.
• Stage 1: Es waren keine großartigen Konter vom Gegner zu erwarten, Ausweichen
war ja nicht vorhanden. Stage 2: Ähnlich wie Stage 1. Stage 3: Wenn Gegner
auswich durch die Rolle, konnte man ziemlich genau zu der Stelle hinrennen, wo er
wieder aufstand, und damit rechnen, ihm erst einmal eine gute Kombo zu geben,
da er darauf nicht direkt reagierte.
• Die gegner waren in allen schwierigkeitsstufen durch reines “draufhauen“ ohne
große gefahr dabei zu sterben zu besiegen.
Dabei wurde es bei stufe 1 noch
am gefährlichsten, dauerte aber durch das ausweichen des gegners in stufe 3 am
längsten, dafür mit der wenigsten gefahr eines gegenangriffs.
• auf allen Stufen: dem Gegner entkommen durch Ausweichen/Rolle d.h. in die
anderen Ecken rennen bzw. rollen um mir sehr viel Zeit zu verschaffen; durch
Angriffs-Spam gewinnen, auch wenn der Gegner zurückschlägt, richtet er insgesamt
weniger Schaden an als der eigene Button-Spam
• Dur das Rollen und vermehrte Blocken des Gegners hatte man in Stufe3 gefühlt
häufiger Zeit zuzuschlagen bzw.
auch wieder wegzurollen, demnach hatte ich
das gefühl ein defensiver Gegner, wie in Stufe3, ist leichter zu besiegen als ein
offensiver, wie in Stufe1.

• Wenn man einmal die Distanz des eigenen Angriffes herausgefunden hat, so war
es möglich den Gegner in die eigenen Angriffe hineinlaufen zu lassen und somit
unbeschadet Angriffe durchzuführen.
• Bis auf die letzte Stufe schien einfach nur draufhauen, als Taktik zu reichen. Erst
in der letzten Stufe war man gezwungen, auch selbst mal auszuweichen.
• Man konnte den Gegner leicht zwingen, die Attacke auszuführen und dann aus
seiner Range entfliehen. Dadurch macht man den Gegner zum leichten Ziel.
• Linksklick Spam hat halt bis Stufe 3 als valide Option funktioniert. War auch nicht
super schwer sich dem Stufe 3 Gegner anzupassen
• In Szene 3 stand der Gegner nach seinem Ausweichmanöver manchmal mit den
Rücken zum Spieler und war dadurch ein leichteres Ziel.
• Sehr viel eigene HP, Gegner dodged in falschen Momenten, Attacken schnell
nacheinander zu spamen half oft den Gegner zu töten
• Den Gegner “auszumanövern“ indem man die Reichweite des Schwertes ausnutzt,
um den Gegner zu pieksen und dabei zu umkreisen.
• Den Kampf, es war recht einfach zu gewinnen ohne viel Ausweichen oder sich
bewegen zu müssen

• Ich denke er ist grundsätzlich schon ganz gut. Eventuell eine Stufe mehr rein
bringen um die Schwierigkeitsteigerung besser anzupassen. Ansonsten wenn es
mal Richtung richtiges Spiel geht, ein flüssigeres Spiel ermöglichen. Dann kann
man sich auch an den härteren Gegnern versuchen ohne Frust zu haben nach dem

• den Schaden der 3. Stufe senken, aber dafür ihr Leben erhöhen. Dadurch wäre
der Gegner weniger demotivierend bzw. man würde mehr experimentieren, wie an
seiner Verteidigung vorbei kommt ohne einen Schlag zu kassieren, statt den vollen
Fokus darauf zu legen, nicht getroffen zu werden.
• weniger Schaden, schnellere Steuerung stage 1: einfach nur button smashen stage
2: viel in Bewegung geblieben und versucht, auf Distanz zu bleiben stage 3: keine
Chance das manuelle parieren hat mir sehr gefehlt (ich weis, ich hab zu hohe
Ansprüche)
• Höhere Mobility des Gegners auf allen Stufen (das er Dodgen kann zB.) und kein
automatischs Blocken - dies könnte mit Rechtsklick erfolgen.
Allg.
sollte der
Gegner nicht so “Clunky“ sein. Damage Werte an sich passen für diese 3-Level-
Präsentation
• “snappier“ movement. Zur Zeit empfinde ich das movement/attack system als zu
unresponsive bzw zu langsam da man nicht aus einem schwerthieb raus dodgen
kann, jedoch eine Attacke lange braucht um zu connecten
• Ich glaube das habe ich schon recht gut bei der Frage nach zu schwer beantwortet.
Blocken/Parieren einführen, Ausweichrolle intuitiver/flüssiger machen, Gegner An-
griff abrechen lassen wenn er getroffen wird.
• Vielleicht die Attack-Animation überarbeiten oder die Attack-Range des Gegn-
ers anpassen, sodass die oben beschriebene cheesy strategy entweder nicht mehr
funktioniert oder sehr viel schwieriger wird.
• Um den Spielspaß über einen längeren Zeitraum zu gewähren, sollte eine Balance
aus Modifikatoren, wie Leben und genommener Schaden, sowie Fähigkeiten der AI
gefunden werden.
• - Bessere Steuerung - schnellerer Input bei Tasteneingaben - 360Crad Roll vermö-
gen (fühlt sich wie 8 Wege System an) - “Cancel´n“ von Angriffen mittels Rollen
• Auf jeden Fall die Reaktionsgeschwindigkeit für die Ausweichrolle verbessern, so-
dass diese im Kampf nützlich wird.
• Animations/Action cancelling würde ungemein helfen. Vor allem in Stage 3 wo
eine zwei Hit-Combo dich erlegt.
• Ich fand die Schwierigkeit im 2. Level schon sehr nah, damit es sich richtig anfühlt.

• 3-4 Hits auf Stufe 3
Answers for the behavioral prototype
• Ich gehe hier nach Features vor, die ich ab einer Stufe einführen und dann konse-
quent beibehalten oder ausbauen würde. Stufe 1: Ab hier sollte die AI in einem 1v1
Szenario einen Lock-On, gleichsam dem des Spielers verwenden. Es erlaubt dem
Spieler mehr Klarheit beim Lesen der Bewegungen und lässt die AI zielgerichteter
wirken/agieren. Stufe 2: Die AI sollte Dodge Rolls sparsamer einsetzen. Oft führt
die AI zwei Dodge Rolls hintereinander aus und das resultiert darin, dass die AI sich
gern auch mal zu nah an eine Wand begibt und offener für Combos ist, aufgrund
des begrenzten Bewegungsspielraums. Stufe 3: Hier könnten noch weitere Kniffe
dazu kommen. Z.B. könnte die AI ohne Lock-On nach einem verfehlten Schlag
Combos abbrechen und sich repositionieren/dodgen, statt weitere Hiebe in die
Leere auszuführen. Weiterhin könnte sie während den Angriffen auch weiterhin
Möglichkeiten der Bewegung nutzen oder auch den Spieler für unüberlegte Dodge
Rolls in ihrer Angriffsreichweite bestrafen.
• Mein erfolgsversprechendstes Vorgehen bei Stufe1 war stupide auf den Gegner
einzuschlagen, da ich das Gefühl hatte, wegrollen lohnt sich nicht. Auch, weil man
nicht die Möglichkeit hat, während des eigenen Schlagens wegzurollen, bzw. wenn
man während des Schlagens wegrollen möchte, auch nachdem der Schlag zuende
ist, nichts passiert. Bei Stufe2 war es ähnlich. Bei Stufe3 hat es sich schon ab
und zu gelohnt zu rollen, Haupttaktik war jedoch auch hier ehr nur draufschlagen.
Die KI selber erschien mir, als würde sie auf meine Angriffe “logisch“ reagieren,
doch dadurch, dass sie nicht alles dogen kann und auch beim Blocken Schaden
bekommt, war Draufschlagen meist erfolgsversprechend. Vielleicht könnte man
eine Mechanik einbauen, sodass man, falls der eigene Schlag geblockt wird, mit
einer gewissen Wahrscheinlichkeit kurze Zeit “gestunned“ ist.
Dafür sollte das
Rollen/Ausweichen mehr Reward bringen.
A30
B.1. General Questions regarding the Prototype
• Die Angriffe der Bots müssten konsequenter sein, also mehr Schaden verursachen.
Somit wäre es um einiges gefährlicher, sich dem Bot für einen Schlag zu nähern,
und man müsste tatsächlich genauer auf das Verhalten des Bots achten, um Fenster
für Angriffe zu finden. Das Powerscaling müsste auch um einiges straffer sein,
sodass Stage 2 gerade so noch machbar ist, und Stage 3 wirklich Zeit und Anstren-
gung benötigt, um gemeistert zu werden. Und somit eben eine Herausforderung
ist. Dem Stage 3 Bot könnten zudem Fähigkeiten gegeben werden, die der Spieler
nicht hat, und um die herum er arbeiten muss - und immer neue Wege finden
muss, da ja die KI die Strategie des Spielers irgendwann kontert. Die Kämpfe
sollten allgemein länger gehen, da in dieser kurzen Zeit (pro Stage vllt 1 Minute)
der Effekt eines “lernenden“ Gegners quasi nicht spürbar war.
• Das Zeitfenster für den eigenen Angriff muss etwas deutlicher sein sodass gutes
Timing belohnt wird, denn Taktik und gezielte Angriffe sind sehr schwierig (Frage
1 begründet). Dafür muss aber auch außerhalb dieses Zeitfensters der Gegner
gefährlicher sein (blocken, parieren, härter zurückschlagen, etc.), denn im Moment
gewinnt man jeden Schlagabtausch durch Spam sobald man mit der eigenen Rich-
tung umgehen kann und nicht daneben schlägt. Das liegt wie in der letzten Frage
beschrieben daran, dass man als Spieler auch im Schlagabtausch eigentlich fast
immer gewinnt. Es ist relativ einfach auch auf höheren Stufen durch aggressiven
Spielstil zu gewinnen, da der Gegner eher dazu tendiert mehr auszuweichen und
nicht mehr Schaden anzurichten.
• Der Gegner Stufe 3 ist definitiv der Gegner welcher den meißten spielspaß liefert.
Die Steigerung der Komplexität ergibt definitiv Sinn, jedoch ist es zu einfach
angriffe zu spammen. Der Schaden der einzelnen Gegner sollte definitiv erhöht
werden, sodas sie auch gewinnen können obwohl sie weniger angreifen. Desweiteren
könnte mit der länge des Hitstuns experimentiert werden. Einfache Gegner werden
eher gestunnt durch angriffe und hohlen länger aus um ihren Angriff durch zu
führen. Schwerere Gegner sind schwerer zu erwischen, da sie weniger Angriffsmo-
mente bieten. desweiteren könnte man für Stufe 3 einfach 2 Gegner nehmen, durch
das aufpassen auf 2 Gegner würde die Komplexität und der Schwierigkeitsgrad
ordentlich steigen.
• Eine Anpassung bei den ersten beiden Schwierigkeitsstufen ist es meiner Meinung
nach nicht nötig. Bei der dritten Schwierigkeitsstufe hatte ich teilweise das Gefühl,
dass es sich eher zufällig anfühlte wenn ich den Gegner treffen konnte und nicht
A31
B. Prototype Test Follow-up Questionnaire
als hätte ich etwas besonders gut gemacht. Man könnte dies vielleicht anpassen,
indem man den Gegner auch nur dann dodgen lässt, wenn der Spieler auch wirk-
lich angreift.
Desweiteren wäre vielleicht ein kleiner Cooldown auf dem dodge
vorteilhaft, um dem Spieler auch Zeitfenster zu geben die er sich quasi erarbeiten
kann.
• Ich würde entweder die maximalen HP des spielers verringern oder den schaden
des gegners erhöhen. Damit würde es notwendiger werden, die spielmechanik des
ausweichens und des blockens zu verwenden. Dafür könnte man dann die zeit zwis-
chen den angriffen des gegners auf der einfachsten schwierigkeitsstufe verlängern
und diese zeit bei steigender schwierigkeit kürzen. Das ließe im einfachsten fall
mehr zeit zum ausweichen.
• Bei Stufe 1 und 2 würde ich den Spieler etwas mehr für Fehltritte bestrafen, also
mehr Hp des Gegner, womit ein Gegenschlag anteilmäßig stärker ist als der eigene,
oder so. Außerdem noch minimal komplexeres Verhalten, dass man nicht einfach
nur stumpf draufhauen kann. Stufe 3 sollte vielleicht etwas transparenter und nich
(gefühlt) gaaanz so random sein
• Meiner Meinung nach weicht mir der Stage-3-Gegner zu oft aus ins nichts, anstatt
effektiv die Angriffe auszuweichen, was aber möglicherweise gar nicht so einfach
machbar ist. Allgemein greifen die Gegner nur einmal an, anstatt hin und wieder
die “3er-Combo“ durchzuführen.
• Der Gegner sollte etwas aggressivere vorgehen und in richtigen Momenten seine
Defensive vernachlässigen, um öfter anzugreifen. Z.B.: Wenn der Spiele gerade
ein paar mal getroffen wurde und deswegen die Flucht ergreifen will, wäre das eine
ideale Situation zum Angreifen.
• Unterschiedliche Angriffsgeschwindigkeiten für unterschiedlich starke Angriffe, Panzerung,
die man erst überwinden muss und ein wenig mehr Intelligenz beim Gegner Auch
das Rückwärtsausweichen wäre ein schönes Feature
• Ihn evtl. auf verschiedene Angriffsmuster des Spielers reagieren lassen. Z.B. wenn
er eine 3er-Kombo ansetzt, direkt eine Kombo zurückgeben, da es ja (meines
Erachtens nach) einen kurzen Cooldown gibt.

mehr Schwierigkeit hinzufügen. Auch das Ausweichen hatte auf mich eher einen

• Er hat sich zu starr angefühlt. Der Übergang von Animationen (und der damit
verbundenen Funktion) hat zu lange gedauert. Kann natürlich auch sein, dass es
aktuell einen Cooldown gibt zwischen den Aktionen. Die Steuerung hat sich sehr
eingeschränkt angefüllt wenn der “Zielmodus“ aktiviert war. Mir ist bewusst, dass
sich die Figur dann relativ zum Ziel bewegt. Aber gefühlt hat sich meine Figur
dann auch langsamer bewegt. Das hat den Spielfluss gestört
• Ja, schnellere Reaktionszeiten auf Input. Der Sprung hat sich auch etwas clunky
angefühlt, irgendwie unrund im letzen Teil der Animation. Diese würde ich mir
auch noch einmal anschauen. Und das Parieren würde ich als extra Taste belegen
(maybe Rechtsklick), da die Sprung-Taste auch exklusiv für die Ausweichrolle da
sein sollte.
• Dodge fühlt sich etwas clunky an, könnte aber auch an der Animation liegen.
Eventuell könnte auch dezentes Input-Queueing helfen, sodass man nach einem
Angriff/Dodge ohne Delay smooth erneut dodgen kann.
Das macht es aber
natürlich auch leichter.
• Dodge Rolle muss sofort ausführbar sein (unterbricht auch den eignen Angriff
um gegnerischen Angriff zu dodgen). kein Automatisches Blocken - stattdessen
Rightclick to Block
• Fühlte sich sehr unsmooth an, Kamera Bewegung mit der Maus auch zu langsam
imo, vlt sowas wie blocken oder Counter einfügen
• siehe frühere Antwort; Der Spielercharakter muss sich schneller bewegen kön-

• Der kleine “Bump“, wenn ein Character aus der Dodge Roll wieder auf die Füße
kommt war im ersten Moment etwas irritierend. Der Stagger im Hit Feedback
passiert etwas zu “ruckartig“ und endet vor allem auch in einer solchen Weise. Eine
kurze Recovery Animation könnte helfen. Z.B.: Character taumelt etwas zurück,
richtet sich wieder zur Idle Haltung auf und ist dann auch wieder kontrollierbar.
• Es könnte etwas schneller sein. Angriffs -und Ausweichanimationen sollte man
unterbrechen können mit Bewegung oder anderen Aktionen.
Jetzt muss man
immer warten, bis der Angriff durchgeführt wurde, anstatt spontan auszuweichen
und den Angriff zu unterbrechen.
• Die Rolle hat einen kleinen Hacken, wodurch sie sich komisch zu verwenden anfühlt,
desweiteren wäre ein auto aim bei nicht gelockter Cam sinnvoll, da man so sonnst
oft einfach nur ins leere schlägt. Ich habe das spiel eigentlich nicht ohne auto aim
gespielt
• Die Rolle fühlte sich sehr undynamisch an.
Oftmals konnte man nicht rollen,
weil man noch in den letzten Animations-frames eines Angriffs, eines Schrittes
oder einer anderen Rolle war. Dadurch hat sich die Bewegung sehr eingeschränkt
angefühlt.
• Es fühlte sich teils etwas sehr undynamisch an, dass man immer auf den kompletten

• Blocken/Parieren einbauen, Ausweichrolle verbessern, Gegner bricht Attacke ab
bei Treffer, Animationen flüssiger werden lassen. Entweder passive Heilung (kurz
wegrennen und dann regeneriert sich das Leben) oder eine aktive Heilung (durch
töten von “einfachen“ gegnern oder halt items) einbauen. Das ist aber natürlich
sehr subjektiv. Ich mag es nicht “unbesiegbare“ Bosse zu haben. Lieber habe
ich herausfordernde Bosse die ich entweder mit viel Skill (punktgenau parieren
wie z.B. die Wächter in The Legend of Zelda BOTW) oder eben durch das gute
alte “Schaden machen, kurz in Deckung heilen“ (so ziemlich jeder moderne Ego
Shooter mit passiver Heilung oder auch sowas wie Horizon Forbidden West mit
aktiver Heilung) besiegen kann. Deswegen habe ich auch Elden Ring nach 30
Minuten wieder deinstalliert. Es ist mir zu herausfordern für den Spaß den es
mit dem Kampfsystem bietet. In Horizon Forbidden West gibt es ebenfalls sehr
herausfordernde Kämpfe aber das sehr gute Kampfsystem machen es eben “fairer“
für den Spieler. Keine Ahnung ob das hier alles Sinn ergibt :D
• Erstmal das Handling, wie oben schon beschrieben. Gameplay-technisch vielleicht
in eine Art Schere-Stein-Papier System umwandeln: Blocken schlägt Angreifen
(man reduziert den Schaden und betäubt den Gegner wenn er genau zu dem
Zeitpunkt angreift und hat somit Zeit für einen Gegenschlag), Angreifen schlägt
Ausweichen (die Rolle ist schneller als ein Block, aber langsam genug, dass man
A38
B.1. General Questions regarding the Prototype
mit einer Angriffscombo hinterherkommt und trifft) und Ausweichen schlägt Block
(die Blockanimation ist so lang, dass man, wenn der Gegner nicht angreift selber
einen Konter riskiert (ähnlich wie der Counter aus Smash Bros.).
• Ich würde ermöglichen früher nach einem Angriff eine Ausweichrolle auszuführen
und potenziell auch die Möglichkeit einbauen, einen Angriff bis zu einem gewis-
sen Zeitpunkt mit einer Ausweichrolle abzubrechen. Alternativ könnte das Poise
System ausgebaut werden. Jedenfalls erschien es so, als würde die KI teilweise
Angriffe abbrechen, wenn sie rechtzeitig getroffen werden. Dann nahm sie eine
Verteidigungshaltung ein. Ich weiß aber nicht, wann so etwas genau passiert ist
und wie ich es ausnutzen kann.
• - mehr Verhaltensmuster - Ausdauerleiste für Konter Zeitfenster, als auch eigenes
Angriffs und Ausweich Managment - schnelle und langsame (starke) Schläge für
mehr Varianz - Im letzten Level : die KI setzt ein Schlag, dreht sich um 180Crad
(wenn umkreist) und schlägt ein weiteres Mal zu, mitten in der Dreh Animation
( falls man in Reichweite ist).
erzeugt Frust weil kaum möglich ist darauf zu
reagieren - Treffer feedback (visuel und akustisch) - wo ist das Parieren ?
• Eine etwas abgetöntere Umgebung, damit diese für die Augen nicht zu anstrengend
ist. Außerdem wäre es gut, nachvollziehen zu können, wann sich die Charaktere mit
beiden Armen schützen - in dieser Zeit könnte etwa der Spieler, wenn der Gegner
gerade beide Arme nach oben vor das Gesicht hält, noch einmal zuschlagen, was
mehr Herausforderung in Sachen Reaktionsfähigkeit und Koordination mit sich
bringen würde.
• ich würde die verschiedenen Gegner anders groß machen (1 Stufe kleiner als, 3
Stufe größer als der Spieler). Die Gegner geben schon zu sehen, dass sie angreifen,
man kann das nur schlecht ausnutzen, da man für die eigene Dodge Roll zu lange
warten muss nach einem Angriff
• Ich hätte gern leichte und schwere Hiebe gehabt. Die unterschiedlich lange dauern
und entsprechen unterschiedlich Schaden machen. Ansonsten die genannten The-
men wie, dass man Animationen abbrechen kann und die Steuerung genauer und
sofort reagiert.
• Eventuell komplexere Machaniken hinzufügen, die den Spieler mehr für gutes
Timing/Dodgen/etc belohnen, z.B. Stamina-System oder Cooldowns/Stun. Eine
weitere Option wären defensive “Timing-Skillchecks“ wie Parry/Blocken.

am Ende der Rolle eine leichte “Hüpfbewegung“, Animation sieht dort etwas holprig

• Ich versuche hier ein paar Feature-Vorschläge zu bringen mit Bedacht auf deren
potenziellen Umfang im Einbau: 1. Eine zweite Art des Angriffs (Heavy Attack)
mit einer eigenen Combo-Linie.
Das würde eine größere Variety an möglichen
Moves mit unterschiedlichen Timings bieten.
2.
Combos, die sich aus einer
Light/Heavy Attack Abfolge mischen lassen, ähnlich wie in Beat’em Ups/Brawlern
-> Light + Heavy + Light // Heavy + Light+ Light. 3. Stagger/Knockback
Time/Intensity abhängig davon, von welchem Move ein Character getroffen wurde.
4. Ein Ressource wie Stamina, die vom Spieler mit Bedacht gemanaged werden
muss und so Buttonmashing riskanter macht, egal ob bei offensiven oder defensiven
Aktionen. 5. Da wir uns hier in einem Schwertkampf Prototypen befinden: Eine
Möglichkeit der Parade, die eine Riposte/Counter Aktion triggern kann und so
dem in die Ecke gedrängten Kämpfer ein Comeback ermöglicht und den Angreifer
genauer abwägen lässt, wie lange ein Ziel vermutlich noch im Stagger Status
verbleiben wird.

B.1. General Questions regarding the Prototype
• Ich bin ein großer Fan von Animation-Canceling und schnellen Vorgängen. Die
langsamen, schweren und den Charakter in der Position festhaltenden Angriffe
haben sich für mich sehr quälend angefühlt.
Man könnte dies damit kompen-
sieren, dass sich die Angriffe sehr mächtig anfühlen, und viel Schaden verursachen.
Oder man erhöht die Geschwindigkeit der Animation, erlaubt schnelle Wechsel von
Angriffen, Verteidigungsschlägen und Rollen. Eine Abwehr-Mechanik würde dem
ganzen vielleicht noch mehr taktische Tiefe verleihen.
• Das rollen sollte meiner meinung nach einen laufenden angriff unterbrechen können.
Das würde das ausweichen sehr viel reaktiver machen. Meistens konnte man einem
gegenangriff gar nicht mehr ausweichen weil dieser schon getroffen hatte bevor man
mit dem rollen starten konnte.
• unterschiedlich starke Angriffe und damit auch unterschiedlich schnelle Angriffe
Darüber hinaus: das Tutorial kann man nicht beenden/verlassen. Man lernt die
Steuerung kennen, darf dann im nächsten Raum einen Testgegner bezwingen und
dann bleibt man stecken im Tutorial

durch blocken, parieren, kritische Gegentreffer, etc.); es ist durch Rollen zu einfach
Distanz zu gewinnen, evtl. den Spieler mehr limitieren oder den Gegner befähigen
besser zu folgen
• Blocken als eigene Aktion, z.b.
auf Rechtsklick.
Ausweichen als verschiedene
Bewegungen z.B. Ausfallschritt/rechts-links ducken/vorwärtsrolle. Belohnung für
combos (mehr schaden, wenn 2-3 fach combo ausgeführt etc)
• Ich würde wahrscheinlich nur das attack-cancelling hinzufügen, damit man ein-
facher auf die Angriffe des Gegners reagieren kann. An sich wäre Blocken auch
ganz nett, ist aber kein muss.
• Die Combos waren Cool, aber es wäre wunderschön, könnte man auch gezielt
blocken mit Rechtsklick, das würde auch Gegner komplizierter machen.
• bisschen mehr Möglichkeiten im Kampf, so Kombos mit Sprung, Parry und so.
Dann eventuell noch bisschen Environment (Bäume, Fässer oder so)
• Rollen auch während man einen Angriff gestartet hat (Angriff dafür abbrechen
bzw. priorisieren). Möglichkeit selbst zu blocken.

B. Prototype Test Follow-up Questionnaire
• Ich persönlich mag so eine Art von Spielen nicht besonders, daher wäre mein
Feedback hier nicht spezifisch genug.
• Eine Erklärung und bessere Resonanz wann und wie man blockt und warum man
das tun sollte.
• Alles etwas schneller und ein etwas aggressiverer Gegner in hören Schwierigkeits-
graden.
• Bessere Grafik, mehr Angriffsmodi, schwierigere KI
• Ein aktives Blocking hinzufügen.
• Attackenvariation

B.4. Meta Artificial Intelligence
Brief description of meta artificial intelligence for the test subjects: In the following, you
will be asked questions about a special form of AI that can be used at runtime to adjust
the game experience and difficulty to the player’s current behavior and abilities. Such
an artificial intelligence or instance is called “meta artificial intelligence“, because the
adjustments are based on collected meta data (e.g. time period over which the player
did not get a hit, speed with which the player got through the level, number of deaths
before successful completion of the level etc.).
A48
B.4. Meta Artificial Intelligence
By using meta artificial intelligence, adaptive difficulty levels can be created, matching
the required skill level to the player’s abilities. Thus, their stress level can be better kept
between the state of physical as well as mental overload and underload (also called flow
state). These adaptations are of course made as subtly as possible, so that a sense of
unfairness is counteracted.
Examples in different application areas to increase the difficulty (of course, the difficulty
level can be decreased in the same way vice versa): - In jump and run games, the
size of platforms, their spacing, or (for moving platforms) their speed can be adjusted
- In combat situations, e.g. the number of enemies to be defeated at the same time,
their damage etc. can be adjusted - In survival games, e.g. diseases or environmental
influences or even enemies can appear more often or faster, if the preparations of the
players guarantee a seemingly effortless survival

adaptive difficulty adjustment?

• Diese letzte Seite fiel mir relativ schwer, da ich eine große Hürde/Herausforderung
bei Meta KI sehe: Die KI muss Dev-seitig irgendwo auch Grenzen aufgezeigt
bekommen. Gute Vorbereitung auf Herausforderungen/Kämpfe darf nicht wertlos
werden, indem die KI über die Maßen starke Gegenschritte einleitet. Verwende
ich im Survival Genre - wie z.B. “The Forest“ oder “Green Hell“ - viel Zeit darauf
mich mit Nahrung, Medikamenten etc. auszustatten, bevor ich in riskantere Zonen
aufbreche, nur um dann durch eine (hier wird es wichtig) NICHT limitierte Meta
A53
B. Prototype Test Follow-up Questionnaire
KI alle paar Minuten “krank“ zu werden würde mich dann in Frage stellen lassen,
ob es dann nicht klüger wäre genau das Gegenteil von dem zu tun, was die Meta
KI erreichen soll: Ein ausgiebigeres Spiel Erlebnis und Wiederspielwert.
Mich
persönlich würde das Wissen, dass ich mir durch Vorbereitung und Planung nur
mehr über die Maßen große Steine in den Weg lege, die ich umgehen kann, dazu
verleiten, so wenig wie möglich Content entdecken zu wollen. Bei Kämpfen darf die
KI zum Beispiel meiner Meinung nach auch kein Flawless Input Reading auf Basis
der Player Actions haben, oder sofort einen Spieler Input + Zusatz abgreifen. So
ein Fall könnte besonders bei RPGs ein Immersion Breaker sein, da es dann die Her-
ausforderung wird das Verhalten einer KI durcheinander zu bringen oder zu brechen,
statt gegen einen spannenden, vermutlich auch lore-trächtigen Gegner anzutreten
und einen Kampf zu erleben, an den man sich gern zurück erinnert. Ebenfalls
wichtig sind hier Limits durch Cooldowns oder eine “unsichtbare“ Ressource, die
auch der KI Grenzen setzt.
Eine Meta KI ist eine sehr spannende Sache und
ich bin ebenfalls gespannt darauf, wie ihr Einsatz Spiele beeinflussen kann, aber
bin ebenfalls davon überzeugt, dass der Datenverarbeitung auch gewisse Grenzen
aufgezeigt werden müssen, um nicht eine Art “TASBot“ Spiel zu erschaffen, was
keinerlei Hebelpunkte mehr für Spieler bietet oder Content Elemente im Spiel
vollständig entwertet.
• Adaptive Schwierigkeiten sind meiner Meinung nach nichts gutes. Nehmen wir als
Beispiel Final Fantasy 7 Remake Integrade. Ich habe dieses Spiel auf “Normal“
begonnen und irgendwann auf “Einfach“ umgeschaltet. Weil ich einige Kämpfe als
zu schwer empfand und das Spiel hauptsächlich für die Story gespielt habe. Hätte
dieses Spiel eine adaptive Schwierigkeit gehabt hätte zwar das Spiel erkannt dass
ich mit Bosskampf X nicht gut klar komme und ihn einfacher gemacht mir aber
nicht die Wahl gelassen, dass jetzt alle Bosskämpfe so einfach werden. Dieses
“rauben“ von Optionen sehe ich generell als Problem in modernen Spielen an. Der
Spieler soll die Optionen haben sich sein Spielerlebnis so anzupassen wie er möchte.
Natürlich nur in Singleplayer spielen. Ich habe kürzlich das Spiel Transport Fever
2 (Spiel indem es um den Aufbau von Logistikketten mit Schiff, Bahn, Flugzeug
und LKWs geht) gespielt. Man muss Ziel X mit Geldmenge Y erreichen. Ich habe
schnell festgestellt, dass mir dieser “Druck“ keinen Spaß macht. Also habe ich mich
(mangels Option im Spiel selber) einem Cheatprogramm bedient um mir unendlich
Geld zu cheaten. Das ist für andere vielleicht unverständlich aber ich habe das
Spiel danach viel mehr genossen. Ich konnte meiner Kreativität freien Lauf lassen
A54
B.4. Meta Artificial Intelligence
und das Logisitknetz so bauen wie ich es für sinnvoll / ansprechend fand (zum
Beispiel lieber Züge statt LKWs bauen) ohne alles optimieren zu müssen etc. Ein
gutes Beispiel ist auch Celeste. Dort gibt es einen “Hilfemodus“. Der erlaubt es
dem Spieler das Spiel selbst angepasst einfacher zu machen wenn nötig. Ohne
diesen hätte ich dieses Spiel nie durchgespielt. Ich konnte mir das Spielerlebnis so
gestalten wie ich es für richtig hielt.
• Ich finde die Idee der adaptiven Schwierigkeit sehr gut, aber es lässt sich nicht
besonders gut auf alle Spiele anwenden.
Ein Roguelike z.B. würde für mich
mehr Sinn ergeben als ein kompetitives Fighting Game, bei dem es um gleiche
Ausgangsbedingungen geht.
Kompetitive Spiele allgemein würden aber extrem
profitieren, wenn KIs entwickelt werden würden, die ähnlich intelligent spielen
wie ein Mensch.
Bei Schach gibt es inzwischen KIs, die das Verhalten von
Menschen nachahmen könnten.
Bei Civilization ist das noch nicht gelungen,
sodass die Entwickler den mathematischen Ansatz fahren und den KIs auf höherem
Schwierigkeitsgrad enorme Vorteile geben, die sie besonders am Anfang gefährlich
machen. Die Entscheidungen der KI sind allerdings weiterhin sehr dumm, sodass,
sobald der Mensch den anfänglichen Rückstand auf die KI aufgeholt hat, er das
Spiel immer gewinnt. Dadurch sind Spiele gegen die KI ab einem bestimmten Skill
eher uninteressant, weil es eigentlich nur darum geht, das early-game irgendwie zu
überstehen. Eine KI, die hingegen entweder eher so “denkt“ und und handelt wie ein
menschlicher Spieler würde sehr reizvoll sein. Man könnte aber auch überlegen, ob
eine adaptive mathematische KI nicht auch funktionieren könnte, die die Vorteile
der KI im Late-Game immer weiter steigen lässt, sodass ihre “Dummheit“ besser
kompensiert wird. Ein super spannendes BA-Thema, darüber könnte man sich auf
jeden Fall ewig unterhalten.
• Ich finde die Idee eines adaptiven Schwierigkeitsgrades in nahezu allen Genres
super, außer Survival. Dort geht es darum, sich möglichst gut auf Unbill vorzubere-
iten, und zu wissen, dass man, ist man schlecht vorbereitet, vom Spiel “verschont“
wird, macht für meine Begriffe den Sinn des Spiels zunichte. Hingegen kann ich mir
vorstellen, dass eine clever verwendete adaptive KI dem Spiel zusätzliche Würze
verleihen könnte, indem Veteranen häufiger oder in größerer Stärke gefährlichen
Situationen ausgesetzt sind, und sich somit gut fühlen können mit der Menge
an getroffenen Vorbereitungen. Ein Survival Spiel sollte den Spieler aber niemals
“schonen“.
A55
B. Prototype Test Follow-up Questionnaire
• Adaptive Schwierigkeits grade sind sehr viel schwerer “zuzuschneiden“ für eine
gewollte erfahrung. Wie im oben genannten Survivalgame Beispiel; ich würde es
unfair finden wenn ich plötzlich mit Gegners überrannt werde/ich genauso viele
Schwierigkeiten habe zu überleben trotz der Ressourcen die ich gesammelt habe.
Außerdem finde ich die Gegenüberstellung von “Individualität“ und “Vision der
Entwickler“ oben als unpassend. Die Vision der Entwickler kann eine individuelle
Erfahrung sein, genauso wie zu viele Ressourcen in einem ’festen’ Schwierigkeitgrad
zusammeln die Vision der Entwickler zerbricht
• Die Antworten sind natürlich auch sehr abhängig davon, was das Spiel sonst noch
zu bieten hat, mir wären wahrscheinlich viele anderen Faktoren Wichtiger, als das
Kampfsystem. Davon hängt aber auch ab, ob ich ein Spiel durchspielen und wie
viel Geld ich dafür ausgeben würde. Ich finde es einerseits natürlich cool jedem
individuell ein Spielerlebnis zu bieten, da ja auch jeder unterschiedliche Fähigkeiten
hat und das Spiel würde sich ja auch mitentwickeln. Jedoch finde ich es auch gut,
wenn klassisch jeder die gleichen Grundvorraussetzungen hat.
• Während des Spielens der 3.
Stufe des Prototypes fing ich nach einer Weile
an, bewusst den Enemy-Lock abzuschalten und schräg seitlich neben den Geg-
ner zu zielen.
Durch den Radius des Schwerthiebs treffen Angriffe dieser Art
trotzdem, während die Wahrscheinlichkeit das der Gegner einen trifft deutlich
geringer ist, wenn man genug Distanz wahrt. Das fühlte sich zwar etwas cheesy
an und reduzierte den Spielspaß, machte es mir aber deutlich einfacher Stufe 3
abzuschließen.
• Ehrlich gesagt habe ich mich damit bisher fast gar nicht befasst, also sei es
mir hoffentlich verziehen, wenn ich aus dem Bauch heraus antworte.
Zudem
würde ich die Entscheidung dafür, ob ich das Spiel kaufen würde, nicht von den
Schwierigkeitsgraden abhängig machen, sondern von Gameplay, Ingame-Setting &
Look. Außerdem habe ich mich für die “Unter-5€“-Kaufoption entschieden, weil
ich Spiele meist im Sale kaufe oder bei Aktionen gratis bekomme.
• Level 3 habe ich mehr oder minder durch einen Exploit gewonnen.
Ich habe
nicht das Lock-On Feature verwendet, sondern habe den Gegner mit der Kamera
angeschaut, dann bin ich so vor ihm weggelaufen, dass er leicht rechts hinter mir
steht. Danach habe ich einen Angriff gestartet, der den Gegner beim Ausholen
trifft und Schaden macht. Meist konnte mich der Gegner dabei nicht mit eigenen
Angriffen treffen.
A56
B.4. Meta Artificial Intelligence
• Ich hatte immer das Gefühl, dass man bei adaptiven Schwierigkeitsgraden als
Spieler etwas schummeln kann. So kann man z.B. sehr schnell spielen und bes-
timmte Aktionen auslassen, sodass die KI mit der Anpassung nicht richtig hinter-
herkommt oder man kann mit Absicht in bestimmten Situationen schlecht spielen,
um die Schwierigkeit zu verringern.
• KI Gegner welche Verhaltensmuster im Bezug auf den Spele (und seine Spielstärke)
verändern ist erstrebenswert, in Sachen Welt und Level design ( in Form von
Rätseln, Shortcuts, Gegnerplatzierung, Architektur und sonstigen Ereignissen gern
Klassisch “starr“ halten
• Die adaptive Schwierigkeit ist für mich weder ein Kaufargument, noch ein Grund
oder Hindernis ein Spiel zu spielen. Meiner Meinung nach ist es egal, ob das Spiel
feste oder variable Schwierigkeit bietet, wenn es ein “gutes Spiel“ ist.
• Es kommt bei den letzten beiden Fragen sehr darauf, ob mich das Spiel von der
Graphik und der Story anspricht, falls dies zu 100% der Fall sein sollte, würde ich
es definitiv nochmal spielen und auch definitiv beenden.
• adaptive Schwierigkeit ist genauso wie Schwierigkeitsgrad und Barrierefreiheit wichtig
und geht mit beiden Hand in Hand, muss aber transparent sein, d.h. evtl. auch
an- und ausschaltbar sein insofern praktizierbar
• die Vorstellung eines sich an den spieler anpassenden spieles ist sehr verlockend aber
trotzdem sollte es die möglichkeit geben, verschiedene vorgefertigte schwierigkeits-
grade des entwicklers spielen zu können
• Ich finde es super interessant und forsche auch selber schon daran. Mich inter-
essiert beispielsweise auch noch eine meta ai auf höheren meta-Ebenen als nur
dem direkten Geschehen im Spiel selbst.
• Alles sehr stark abhängig von der Art des Spiels, passt mMn besser bei einem
Roguelike oder Survival Game als bei einem RPG.
• Super interresantes Konzept, stelle ich mir grade bei Mechaniken von Spielen wie
Dark Souls oder so mega gut vor
• Sehr nice idee

D&D 5.0 COMBAT REFERENCE SHEET
MOVE
ACTION
Each round represents 6 seconds in 
the game world. Anything a person 
could reasonably do in 6 seconds, 
your character can do in 1 round.
Each round, during 
your turn, you can 
move and take one 
action.
• 
You don’t have to move.
• 
Your total distance moved can not exceed 
your speed.
• 
You can move before or after you take 
an action / or you can move first, take an 
action, then move again.
• 
Your move can include jumping, climbing, 
swinging, or moving any way that your 
character is capable of.
• 
You don’t have to take an action.
• 
You can attempt to do anything that could 
be accomplished in 6 seconds or less. 
• 
The most common action taken in combat 
is the attack action. (Refer to “Combat 
Actions” on back of this sheet.)
• 
If your action permits multiple attacks, 
you can move between attacks if you 
have not exceeded your speed.
OTHER THINGS YOU MAY DO ON YOUR TURN
 INTERACT WITH ONE OBJECT
 MAYBE A BONUS ACTION
DO OTHER SIMPLE ACTIVITIES
MAYBE A REACTION
You can manipulate one object in an 
uncomplicated way. (i.e.):
• Draw or sheath a weapon
• Transfer item from one hand to the other
• Load crossbow
• Retrieve or put away a stored item
• Pick up an item
• Move an object
• Open a chest
• Open a door
Doing more than one of these things 
requires the use of an action.
A special ability, spell, or other feature of the 
game may allow you take an aditional action, 
called a bonus action. You are only allowed 
one bonus action in a round.(i.e.)
• If you have a short sword in one hand and 
dagger in the other, after using your action to 
attack with the sword, you can use a bonus 
action to attack with the dagger 
(refer to the rules on two-weapon fighting.)
Within reason, you can do things that take 
little or no time and don’t interfere with your 
movement.(i.e.):
• Drawing ammunition for use with a ranged
weapon (such as arrows, bolts, sling 
bullets, or shuriken).
• Dropping an item to your feet or within 5
feet of your current location.
• Dropping to a prone position.
(Standing up from prone, however, takes 
half of your movement for the turn.)
• Speaking
A special ability, spell, etc. might allow you to 
react to a specific triggering event. You are 
only allowed one reaction in a round. Your 
reaction does not have to occur during
your turn. If it occurs during another’s turn, 
his turn is suspended until your reaction is 
resolved.(i.e.)
• Wizard’s feather fall spell is triggered when 
the Wizard falls.
• If an opponent attempts to move past you / 
or attacks you then attempts to move away - 
you get a free opportunity attack.
If surprised, you lose your turn for the first round of combat. This 
includes losing use of any reaction for one round, measured from 
the beginning of combat until the start of your turn on round two.
COMBAT ACTIONS
During your turn in a combat round, you can 
perform any one of the following actions.
ATTACK
CAST A SPELL
DASH
DISENGAGE
DODGE
HELP
USE AN OBJECT
READIED ACTION
IMPROVISED ACTION
HIDE
SEARCH
You can make one melee or 
ranged attack. Some features may 
allow you to make more than one 
attack with this action.
You can cast any spell that you are 
capable of casting that has a listed 
casting time of one action.*
You spend the entire round 
moving. This allows you to move 
twice as far this round. It is 
effectively a double move action.
If you start the round within 5 feet 
of opponent you can see, move 
away from him without provoking 
an opportunity attack.
Until start of your next turn. You 
have Adv on DEX saving throws 
and if you can see the attacker 
attacks against you have Disad. 
Help ally attack opponent within 5 
feet of you. His first attack roll is 
made with Adv. Or you can help 
him (has Adv) with any other task.
An object may require an action 
for you to use it, or you may need 
to use this action to interact with 
more than one object in a round.
Instead of an action during your turn, wait for some 
specific event. Then take your action as a reaction. 
You can still move up to your speed, but you can take 
no other action this round.
1) Must say what the triggering event will be.
Can be anything you think might happen that you can 
observe. If the event occurs before the start of your 
turn on the next round you can perform your readied 
action at that time. 
2) Must say what action you will take.
This can be any of the combat actions.
(Note that this action will be a reaction and you can 
only have one reaction per round. This means that 
if you take another reaction, you lose your readied 
action. Conversely, if you use your readied action you 
can have no other reactions this round.)
• If the triggering event occurs, you can choose to not 
take your readied action.
• Dash: You can move up to your speed.
• Cast a Spell: Cast the spell during your turn 
but hold off on releasing the energy of the spell 
until the triggering event. You must concentrate to 
hold the spell’s energy. If something breaks your 
concentration, the spell is lost. If the triggering event 
doesn’t occur this round, you can continue to hold the 
spell with continued concentration into the following 
round, or you can cast it as an action on your next 
turn, or you can lose it.
Anything not covered by any of the above actions.
1. You must explain the improvised action to the DM. 
The DM may rule that what you want to do will require 
more than one round, or that it is simply impossible. 
The DM may ask you to be more specific regarding 
the action you want to take and how the action will 
achieve the results you want.
2. The improvised action can also include all or part 
of your move. Successfully jumping on a creature will 
give you advantage on the attack roll. A failed attempt 
results in your move stopping at the point where the 
attack takes place and may grant your opponent Adv 
on his next attack against you.
3. To perform the improvised action the DM will 
normally have you make an ability check. The DM will 
assign an appropriate difficulty class and will explain 
possible consequences if the attempted action fails. 
For example, if you attempt to jump off of the balcony 
onto the monster in the center of the room and miss 
you may end up prone.
If you can’t be seen, make a DEX 
(Stealth) check to hide. Your check 
must beat your opponents WIS 
(Perception) check.
Use your action to attempt to find 
something. The DM might require 
you to make a Wisdom check or 
an Intelligence check.
* Components: Retrieving a material (M) component is included in the spell’s action. If the spell also has a somatic (S) 
component, you can perform required hand gestures while holding the material component in the same hand. If you are 
holding two weapons, you can sheath one weapon and then draw the material component and cast the spell all in the 
same round. [A material component is not consumed with the casting of the spell, unless otherwise specified]

Introduction 
D&D Wars is a supplement to D&D 5E that provides a set 
of mass combat rules for conducting battles with units as 
small as one to armies numbering in the thousands. D&D 
Wars are not simply armies making battle with each 
other. It is armies intermixed with monsters and NPCs. 
Added to this mix is a group of PC heroes doing what 
they can to change the tide of the war. 
Overview 
Most of the rules for D&D Wars are identical to those for 
D&D 5E. Any time that the rules presented here don’t 
cover a specific situation, refer to the official D&D 5E 
rules. 
Before doing battle the DM will have to set the stage. 
To conduct D&D Wars you must take the following steps. 
1st - Create opposing armies consisting of units that will 
later battle each other on a battle grid. 
2nd - (Optional) Add monsters. Sure you can have a unit 
of skeletons, but imagine having a couple of beholders, 
or black dragons, or even rust monsters moving about 
the battlefield! 
3rd - (Optional) Add Non Player Characters (NPCs). 
Individual units may have leaders that are different from 
the rest of the unit and they may be guarded by a group 
of elite guards. Units may also contain NPC spell casters 
or healers. 
4th - (Optional) Define the role of the Player Characters 
(PCs). They may each command a separate unit, or they 
may take on the more traditional role of operating as a 
separate squad to attack monsters and NPCs. D&D Wars 
can be played without PCs, but your players existing 
characters can play a part in the battle. 
5th - Draw the field of battle on your battle matt and 
place all of the combatants. 
6th – Let the battle commence! 
The Grid 
D&D Wars uses a square grid. This is a battle mat 
consisting of one inch squares. One square represents 
15 ft. (Refer to the chapter “optional rules for larger or 
smaller battles”.)  
The Combatants 
D&D Wars’ combat rules can handle large groups. There 
are specific rules to cover combat between different 
types of groups and creatures. (A combatant can be a 
human or humanoid or any type of beast or monster, so 
the term “creature” is used.) The different types of 
potential combatants are listed here: 
Units - Each side in a war will have an army. Each army 
contains one or more group of creatures called a unit.  A 
unit is a group of creatures that fight as a single 
creature. Units are the primary ‘characters’ of the D&D 
Wars system. They receive orders, move, fight, and 
react as if they were individuals.  
Tokens - Each unit will start with 20 tokens. These are 
used as physical markers to represent units on the battle 
mat. You can make tokens of 1” squares or circles of 
cardboard. You should color or mark them in some way 
to indicate which unit they belong to. Alternately, 
checkers or poker chips could be used. Each token 
represents 10 creatures in the unit. 
Singular Creatures - In addition to the units, there may 
be some combatants that act independently. Many of the 
rules are different for singular creatures than they are for 
units. These are typically represented on the battle mat 
by miniatures (see below). 
Monsters - These are singular creatures that move about 
the battlefield and act independently. These are 
creatures that are not part of any unit. 
NPCs - Non Player Characters. These are singular 
creatures that are embedded in a unit as leaders or 
Special Forces. NPCs move as the unit they are in 
moves, but they act independently regarding fighting or 
other actions. 
PCs - Player Characters. These are the singular 
creatures. They are characters created and controlled 
by the players as described in the D&D 5E rules. The 
rules here make no assumptions regarding the PCs level. 
They begin combat embedded in a unit. They can each be 
in a separate unit or they can all be in the same unit. 
After combat begins, they are free to leave the unit and 
move about the battlefield as desired. If the PCs move 
around the battlefield as a group, this group of PCs is 
referred to as a “squad”. 
Miniatures - Traditionally these are 25mm plastic or 
metal figures that were molded and painted to look like 
the creature that they represent. D&D Wars uses these 
to represent singular creatures on the battle grid. No 
D&D Wars 
By Ronny Hart—January 2015 
miniature should have a base larger than the 1 inch battle 
grid. If a singular creature is in a unit, place the miniature 
that represents it on top of one of the Tokens in the unit. If 
the PCs are together in a squad, select a single miniature 
to represent the entire squad. Other than PCs when they 
are in a squad, there should not be more than one singular 
creature in one square. 
Chapter 1 - Units 
A small army may have as few as one unit, while larger 
armies may have several.  
The Unit 
If an army contains more than one type of creature, each 
different creature type will belong to a separate unit. The 
only requirement for the composition of a unit is that it be 
made up of combatants that are all the same. [They must be 
the same size and speed and their level, armor, weapons, 
etc. must be similar enough that the statistics for a typical 
unit’s member can be used to represent the stats for the 
unit as a whole.] An army can also have multiple identical 
units.  
Space requirements 
All creatures occupy the amount of space that is standard 
for their creature size. A unit can take any shape on the 
field, as long as every token is connected to at least one 
other token in the unit along one of its 4 sides and that 
they are all in a relatively compact space with no “holes”.  
Each 1 by 1 in. square on the battle mat represents 15 by 
15 ft. One token represents 10 creatures but the tokens 
are different sizes depending on the size category of the 
creature. 
Behind the DM Screen: Using standard D&D 5E rules, a 15 
foot square would contain 9 medium or small creatures. 
D&D Wars allows for 10 creatures in a token to make the 
math easier. We can assume that creatures in a unit are a 
little closer together than individual creatures are in a 
dungeon. 
Number of Tokens 
When the first formed, each unit contains 20 tokens. As 
the unit takes damage the number of Tokens will be 
reduced. When a unit loses the hit point equivalent of 10 
creatures a token is removed. [The DM may create units 
with any number of Tokens as suits the scenario he 
envisions. He may for example wish to have 30 fire drakes 
attack as a unit with only 3 Tokens. If you desire to have 
more or less than 10 creatures in a token refer to the 
section on “Non-standard Units” in the chapter “Optional 
rules for larger or smaller battles”.] 
The Unit’s Hit Points 
The unit starts out with a number of hit points equal to the 
total number of hit points of all of the creatures in the unit 
(200 times the hit points of one creature). When the unit’s 
number of hit points is reduced by one token (10 times the 
hit points of one creature), one token is removed from the 
unit. Even when the units hit points are down, each token 
still represents 10 creatures. 
Designing a Unit 
Let’s say you want to create a unit that consists of first 
level dwarf fighters. You can use the stat block for a typical 
creature in the unit to represent the entire unit. The typical 
fighter in your unit might have this stat block: 
DWARF FIGHTER 
Medium Humanoid (Dwarf), Lawful Good 
Armor Class 18 (chain mail, shield) 
Hit Points 12 
Speed 25 Ō. 
 
Skills AcrobaƟcs +3. AthleƟcs +5, InƟmidaƟon +2, Survival +3

Shortbow Range Weapon AƩack: +3 to hit, range 80/320, one target,  
Hit: 4 (1d6+2) piercing damage 
 
Using the stat block for tokens and units: 
You may want to make some notations on the stat bock.

Giving names to each of the units is optional, but it may 
help when running the battle to be able to refer to the units 
by name.

AC: The armor class for the unit is the same as it is for a 
single creature in the unit. 
Unit HP: 2400 This is the starting number of hit points for the 
unit. Arrived at by multiplying the token hit points by 200 
(the number of creatures in the unit). This number will be 
reduced as the unit received damage. You will need to keep 
track of the units current hit point total. 
Token HP: 120 This is the maximum number of hit points for one 
token. There are 10 creatures in a token so this is the 
number of hit points for a single creature in the token times 
10. When the unit’s hit points are reduced by this amount, 
one token is removed. At any point in time, the number of 
tokens in a unit is equal to the unit’s current hit points 
divided by a single tokens hit points (rounded up). In this 
example, if the unit’s current hit points are 2000 it will 
have 17 tokens (2000/120=16.666). 
Speed: 25 ft. (2 squares) A units speed is the same as the 
creatures speed. Because we are using 15 ft. squares you 
can calculate the number of squares by dividing the speed 
by 15 (rounding up). Note that this makes a speed of 25 
the same as a speed of 30. 
Abilities, Skills, etc.: The unit has the same abilities ratings and 
such as the typical creature in the unit, although many of 
them will not be used in mass combat situations. 
Actions: Refer to the rules below for resolving combat. Use 
the ranges and plusses to hit in the creature’s stat block. If 
a typical creature in the unit normally gets multiple attacks, 
the token that is attacking also gets multiple attacks. If a 
unit is fighting against more than one other unit and/or 
singular creatures, then different tokens may be attacking 
different foes. However, all attacks that a single token 
makes on one round must be against the same target. 
Multiply the damage by 10 (the number of creatures in a 
token) for each token involved in an attack. In those rare 
instances where an individual creature in the unit attacks, it 
deals the standard damage for one creature as indicated 
on the stat block.  
Unit types: 
Unmounted Units: 
These form the core of most forces. These include infantry, 
skirmishers and archers. These units receive no special 
bonuses or penalties. 
Mounted Units: 
If the creatures that make up a unit are mounted, the unit 
tokens represent both them and their mounts. If the 
creatures are mounted on large mounts (men on horseback, 
for example) or if they are riding in chariots, use 2 inch 
Tokens and each token will represent the 10 creatures and 
their 10 mounts. The unit gains advantage to attacks 
against any unit that is not mounted or that is not equipped 
with reach weapons. The unit uses its mounts’ speed for 
movement.  
Flying Units: 
Flying units are determined the same as regular units (for 
example, a unit of mounted griffon riders would be created 
the same as regular mounted units). If a flying unit attacks a 
grounded unit from above, it has advantage on the attack. 
Intelligent Mounts: 
The above rules assume that the mounts are unintelligent. 
As such, it is assumed that they are not the target of 
attacks, therefore their hit dice are not included in the 
Unit’s Hit Points. However, in special cases, such as 
troops riding dragons or other fierce monsters capable of 
carrying the fight without a rider, add the number of Hit 
Points for the mount as well. For example, if the rider had 
30 hit points and the mount 40, the hit point count would 
be 70 per token. 
Mobs: 
A mob is a unit that is a large, disorganized mass. Mobs 
are generally made up of creatures whose intelligence 
scores are too low for disciplined order, such as a pack of 
hyenas or a group of gargoyles or a mass of villagers with 
torches and pitchforks. Mobs move as a unit and have the 
following characteristics: 
• A mob’s first melee attack is always considered a charge, 
even if it doesn’t move the normally required two squares. 
• A mob cannot form a Phalanx Formation. 
• A mob cannot set weapons against a charge. 
• For all range attacks, only those Tokens who have direct 
line of sight to the enemy may attack. 
• A mob must make a DC 15 Wisdom check before every 
charge, if it fails this check it doesn’t attack that round. 
• A mob must make a DC 15 Wisdom check each round 
that it receives a critical hit that does damage, if it fails 
this check it uses a its next round to disengage and back 
away no more than 2 squares. It may attempt a charge 
again the following round. 
• A routed mob scatters and cannot be rallied. 
Units that contain War Machines: 
A unit that contains a siege weapon, siege tower or 
battering ram is a special type of unit. Refer to Chapter 7 - 
War Machines for information regarding these units. 
Chapter 2 – Monsters 
In addition to the units, the battlefield may also contain 
monsters that are singular creatures. These can be any 
By Ronny Hart—January 2015 
5 
creature that is not a member of a unit. A monster is never 
embedded in a unit. 
Examples of Monsters: 
• A red dragon finds the war an opportune time to attack 
both armies. 
• A unit of gnomes has befriended a couple of ogres that 
are accompanying them on their raid of the local village. 
• An invading army of githyanki are accompanied by two or 
three beholders.  
The following applies to all monsters: 
• Regardless of its size, each monster occupies one 
square on the battle matt. It will typically be represented 
by a miniature. (If you want several similar monsters to stay 
together on the battlefield, you could make them a unit 
instead.) 
• Monsters can move through both allied and enemy units. 
• They move through allied units without restriction. The 
friendly creatures that make up the unit move aside (getting 
closer together). If a monster stops in a unit, you can 
simply place the figure that represents the monster on top 
of a unit token. 
• They can fight their way through enemy units at an 
effective speed of one square per round. To do this they 
make a normal melee attack against the unit. If they 
succeed in doing at least one point of damage to the unit, 
the monster can then move in that same round into the 
square occupied by the token it was attacking. Otherwise it 
remains in the square it was in. 
Each monster is a singular creature with its own Hit Points. 
Its hit points are no different than they would be for a 
standard D&D 5E monster. They can use a standard stat 
block. 
Chapter 3 – NPCs 
In addition to the creatures that make up units, each unit 
may also contain one or more NPCs (non-player characters). 
These NPCs are “embedded” in the units. They move when 
the unit moves. Each NPC in a unit occupies the amount of 
space that is standard for his creature size, but this does 
not increase the space occupied by the unit. The other 
creatures in the unit move closer together than normal to 
accommodate the NPC. The NPC doesn’t have to be the 
same type or level of creature that makes up the unit, and 
is never counted as part of the unit. 
Examples of NPCs 
• A vampire is the leader of an extremely large unit of 
skeletons and has surrounded himself with an elite guard of 
5 fourth level evil clerics. The vampire would be an NPC and 
the 5 clerics would each be an NPC. 
• The next kingdom over is attacking your homeland. The 
general has placed a couple of sorcerers in four or five of 
his rear units. Each of the sorcerers would be an NPC. If 
the general is in a unit, he will also be an NPC. 
• A unit of kobolds has a kobold wizard as a leader and he 
has two dire wolves protecting him. The kobold leader is an 
NPC, and the dire wolves are NPCs. 
NPC are in all ways identical to Monsters, with the following 
exceptions: 
NPCs can leave a unit and act independently on the 
battlefield, but they start out in a unit and most will stay 
within that unit through the battle. 
NPCs move through allied and enemy units the same way 
that monsters do. 
When the unit that an NPC is embedded in moves, the NPC 
moves with it. He uses the same speed as the unit and 
moves as the unit moves. If the unit performs a Dash 
action, the NPC can take no other action that round. 
Chapter 4 - PCs 
The PC’s (player character’s) role in the war needs to be 
determined before the battle begins. One option is to have 
each PC be a unit leader. He will make all of the decisions 
for the unit that he is embedded in. Another option is for 
each of the PCs to be at different locations across the 
battlefield performing separate, independent actions. A 
third and perhaps the most “typical” option is to have all of 
the PCs acting together as a small independent squad. 
PCs use their standard D&D character sheets.  
PC Squads 
When the PCs are working together in a group (as they 
normally do in standard D&D combat) we will refer to them 
in D&D Wars as a “squad”. This squad is NOT a unit. It is 
simply an efficient way to track the location of the PCs as a 
group. A squad typically contains only PC but may also 
contain NPCs and animal companions or familiars if they 
would normally accompany the PCs in a battle. 
The squad is represented on the battle matt by a single 
miniature. Its move rate is determined by the slowest 
member of the squad. It can move through allied units and 
fight its way into enemy units as a monster does. A squad 
moves as a monster does, but otherwise each individual PC 
acts as he chooses, attacking, casting spells or performing 
any other acts as he would normally do in a combat 
situation. 
Experience Points 
PCs earn experience point awards by two means: through 
normal combat awards for creatures that they themselves 
D&D Wars for the fifth edition of Dungeons and Dragons 
6 
defeat in combat, and through story awards given based on 
character level and challenge of the scenario. 
Chapter 5 - The Battlefield 
The DM draws the battlefield map on the combat grid at 
the appropriate scale. 
Terrain 
Terrain features function the same in D&D Wars as in the 
standard rules for D&D 5E. If the DM designates a square 
as difficult terrain it counts as 2 squares of movement. 
Flying and incorporeal creatures are not hampered by 
difficult terrain. The DM may want to assign additional 
restrictions based on terrain. For example, the canopy of 
the Black Forest may impose a disadvantage on attacks 
from flying units.  
Structures 
Structures provide cover. Units within ruins, sturdy wooden 
buildings or light stone buildings have1/2 cover if they are 
guarding the walls, or firing range weapons. If doing so 
within a small stone keep, heavy stone building or stone 
castle they have 3/4 cover. Units in fortifications that are 
not exposed or attacking have total cover. Units firing from 
the top of a wall have advantage when targeting units on 
the ground. 
Placing the combatants 
Before placing the armies, the players and the DM must 
decide what role each player will have in the battle. Some 
players may only want to control their own PC and that is 
all. This is a perfectly acceptable option. However, no one 
is likely to want to sit back and just watch while the DM 
conducts a war between two armies. At least the players 
should control units in their friendly armies while the DM 
controls the opposition units. Ideally, players will control 
most, if not all, of the units and NPCs in all of the armies 
and perhaps the monsters as well. This would be a good 
time to bring in another group of players to handle the 
oppositions army. Of course this all depends on the size 
and complexity of the planned battle. 
A battle can be played without monsters, NPCs or even 
PCs. One person can play one unit or one army. You may 
want to play this way for a time or two before adding the 
complexity of monster, etc.  
1) Place the Units 
After the DM has drawn the battlefield terrain it is time for 
the armies to position their units. If one group is the 
aggressor, the defending army places its units first. 
Otherwise each army rolls 1d20. The winning side decides 
if they want to place their units first or last. It is normally 
advantageous to places your units last. 
All of the Tokens for a single unit must be placed with at 
least one side adjacent another token in the same unit. 
Units can be placed as desired. Units can be adjacent to 
each other, but cannot overlap.  
After all of one armies units have been placed the next army 
can place its units. These can be placed in any logical 
location with no unit closer than 6 squares to any of its 
opponents. The DM has the final say as to where units are 
allowed to be placed. He may want to rule that faster units 
be placed in front of slower units, or that all units in a 
particular army need to be placed on the same end of the 
battle mat. There may be some units that will not enter the 
battlefield until sometime after the battle starts. There may 
be some areas of the map where certain units are not 
allowed. 
2) Place the Monsters 
After all of the units for all armies are placed, place the 
monsters. These must be placed in squares that are not 
occupied by a unit. A monster that is allied with an army can 
be placed no closer than 8 squares to an enemy unit and 
must be closer to an allied unit than it is to any enemy unit. 
A monster that has no allied army (will attack anybody) must 
be placed an equal distance from two units of opposed 
forces and at least 8 squares away. If this is not possible, 
place it at least 12 squares away from the closest unit of a 
randomly determined army. 
3) Place NPCs 
After placing all of the units and monsters, place all of the 
NPCs. Each NPC will start the battle in a unit. Until or 
unless an NPC leaves a unit, it is considered embedded in 
the unit. The location of the figure in the unit does not 
represent its exact location within the unit, but only 
indicates that that NPC is embedded somewhere within that 
unit. There must always be at least one more token in a unit 
than the total number of NPCs in the unit. 
4) Place the PCs 
Lastly, have each player place his or her PC. Like NPCs, 
each PC must start the battle in an allied unit. If all of the 
PCs start in the same unit, place a single figure in that unit 
to represent the PC’s squad. Like NPCs, the location of 
the PCs figure in the unit is not important as it simply 
indicates that the PC is embedded somewhere within that 
unit.

Chapter 5 - Combat 
Overview 
The number of hit points in a unit, or in a single token is 
quite large in comparison to a single creature. So the 
damage done to units by singular creatures is typically 
quite small in comparison. It makes very little sense for a 
singular creature to attack a unit unless it can do massive 
damage. It also means that the damage that a unit does to 
a singular creature can be quite large. 
Most D&D Wars combat rules are identical to those of D&D 
5E with the following differences: 
Calculating Damage 
Single creature damage: When an attack is successful, use 
the standard stats for a single creature to determine 
damage.  
Damage per token: If the attacker was a unit, roll for 
damage as if it were a single creature attacking. Multiply 
that damage by 10 (the number of creatures in a token) to 
determine the amount of damage done by one token. 
When a Unit Attacks another Unit 
Melee Attacks 
When a unit’s melee attack is against another unit, multiply 
the damage per token by the number of tokens involved in 
the attack. 
Example: A unit is engaged in melee with another unit. When 
the unit makes a successful attack, only the tokens that are 
on the front line are doing damage. Multiply the damage by 
the number of tokens that have at least one side adjacent 
to tokens belonging to the enemy unit. The damage is 
subtracted from the opposing unit’s hit points. 
Range Attacks 
Most ranged weapons are propelled upwards in a diagonal 
45 deg. arc when used in mass combat. This allows for 
maximum range, as well as ensuring that all the archers or 
javelin-throwers in a unit can shoot at the same time. Thus, 
for most ranged attacks every token can shoot at once, so 
long as at least one token has direct line of sight to the 
enemy. Any reduction in accuracy caused by this indirect 
attack is more than compensated for by sheer volume of 
fire. For calculating damage, figure the area of effect by 
comparing the number of tokens in the attacking unit to the 
number of tokens in the unit being attacked. Multiply the 
damage per token by the number of attacking tokens, not 
to exceed twice the number of tokens in the defending unit.  
Crossbows have a far flatter trajectory. When resolving 
crossbow attacks, only those tokens who have direct line 
of sight to the enemy may attack. Multiply the damage per 
token by the number of tokens that attack. 
Collateral Damage 
If one or more singular creatures are in a unit when it takes 
damage from another unit they may receive damage as well, 
additional damage rolls are not required. All damage 
received by singular creatures in this manner is in addition 
to the damage to the unit. If the attack is a charge or a 
melee attack, these singular characters will receive no 
damage unless they have purposely placed themselves on 
the front line that is being attacked. If they are on the front 
line, calculate their damage as if the unit had attacked them 
(refer to “When a Unit attacks a Singular Creature” below). 
If a unit receives damage from ranged weapon attacks 
these creatures may receive damage. If the attacking unit 
has fewer tokens than the target unit, the singular creature 
receives no damage, otherwise it receives the indicated 
“single creature damage” unless it makes a DC 15 
Dexterity save for half damage. If the singular creature took 
a Dodge action on its last round, it receives half damage 
(or no damage if it makes its Dexterity save).  
When a Unit attacks a Singular Creature 
A unit may only attack a singular creature if the creature is 
not in an enemy unit. A unit can attack multiple singular 
creatures - up to the number of tokens in the unit. It makes 
one attack and damage roll for each target.  
Melee Attacks 
A unit can only attack a singular creature that is within the 
attacking unit, or that is in an adjacent square.  
When a unit’s melee attack is against a singular creature 
use “singular creature damage”. Multiply the damage by the 
number of creatures, not the number of tokens, involved in 
the attack. If the singular creature is surrounded, you can 
use the standard D&D 5E rues for the number of characters 
that can attack a single creature. Otherwise you can 
arrange figures on a standard 5 ft. grid to visualize how 
many singular creatures in the unit can attack at the same 
time. Once you have determined the number of creatures 
that can attack, multiple the “singular creature damage” by 
this number. 
Example: A unit of orcs is attacking a PC that has moved 
into the center of their unit. The PC (a medium size 
character) is surrounded by orcs (also medium size 
creatures). The PC can be attacked by 8 orcs so, if the 
attack is successful the singular creature damage is 
multiplied by 8. 
Range Attacks 
Only those Tokens that have direct line of sight to the 
target creature may attack. If the target creature is size 
category Huge or larger, multiply the damage per token by 
the number of tokens that attack. 
D&D Wars for the fifth edition of Dungeons and Dragons 
8 
If the target creature is smaller than that, only one in three 
of the creatures in a token have a clear line of sight so 
divide the damage per token by 3. 
When a Singular Creature Attacks a Unit 
When a singular creature successfully attacks a unit, the 
damage it inflicts is applied to the unit as a whole.  
Example: A Monster is attacking a unit. When the Monster 
makes a successful attack against the unit’s armor class and 
his damage roll and adjustments indicate 23 points of 
damage. The damage is subtracted from the unit’s current 
hit points. 
When a Singular Creature Attacks another 
Singular Creature 
When a singular creature attacks another singular creature, 
the damage is applied exactly as in standard D&D 5E 
combat rules. 
If there are multiple singular creatures involved, you may 
want to use a separate battle matt (or a portion of the 
larger one that is off to one side) and set it up with each 
square representing 5 ft. to resolve this “mini battle” using 
standard D&D 5E combat rules. 
Other Considerations 
The following rules are never used in combat involving units: 
Opportunity attack, Grapple, Help, Hide, Hinder, Knock 
Down, Dying (units can rout, disperse or surrender, but 
they don’t die.) 
Singular creatures follow standard D&D combat rules when 
attacking each other. A singular creature follows standard 
D&D rules when reduced to 0 hit points. 
The Round 
A combat round in D&D Wars represents 6 seconds in the 
game. In one round, each unit and each singular creature 
will normally have a chance to act. 
Initiative 
Before the first round of combat begins, each unit and each 
monster makes an initiative check. PCs and NPCs do not 
make initiative checks at this time, as they all begin combat 
embedded in units. Units that have an embedded leader 
(NPC or PC) adds their leader’s charisma modifier to the 
check. The DM finds out what order the units and monsters 
are acting in, counting down from highest result to lowest, 
and each unit or monster acts in initiative order, with the 
check applying to all rounds of the combat. 
A singular creature that is within a unit will act on that unit’s 
initiative. If a singular creature enters a unit his initiative 
becomes the same as the unit he enters. If a singular 
creature leaves a unit and is on the battlefield on his own, 
in subsequent rounds his initiative will be one less than the 
initiative of the unit he left. 
If the PCs are together in a squad, when the squad leaves 
its original unit each PC receives a separate initiative. Each 
PC makes an initiative roll. The results of these rolls are 
compared to determine each PCs initiative order. The 
highest receives an initiative order that is one less than the 
unit he left. The others take an initiative order behind his, 
from highest to lowest. 
Surprise 
In most cases there is no need to determine surprise in 
mass combat. By its very nature, combat on this scale 
negates the element of surprise. If surprise is possible 
(invisible creatures?) use standard D&D 5E rules to resolve 
it.  
Movement 
Each round a unit or singular creature can move and take 
one action. A unit has the same speed as the typical 
creature that makes up the unit. If it takes the Dash action 
the total distance moved can be up to double the 
creature’s speed. 
What a Singular Creature can do in a Round 
Each round, each singular creature can move and take one 
action. Use standard combat rules for D&D except where 
noted otherwise. If the creature is not in a unit, it takes its 
turn in the initiative order. If any singular creatures are in a 
unit, they each get to act on that units turn in initiative 
order. Their actions are all resolved before the unit acts 
(refer to inter-unit actions below). 
What a Unit can do in a Round 
Each round, on its turn in the initiative order, a unit can take 
one “unit move action” and one “unit combat action”. The 
unit move action can come before or after the unit combat 
action. As a bonus action, a unit can change formation 
before, after, or instead of a unit move action.  
Unit Move Actions 
Move: The unit can move up to the number of squares 
indicated by its speed in any direction including diagonally 
(no penalty for moving diagonally). The unit maintains its 
current formation while moving. 
Pass Through: As part of its move, the unit can move up to 
the number of squares indicated by its speed and pass 
through another allied unit. On the unit’s turn it simply 
moves through the occupied area of the other unit. A unit 
must end the round completely in unoccupied squares. If it 
cannot do so, then both units can perform no other action 
for the rest of the round, until the first unit has moved 
completely out of the other unit’s area. 
By Ronny Hart—January 2015 
9 
Charge: A unit can charge another unit or a singular 
creature that is not in a unit.  The unit must start its round 
at least two squares away from the opponent it is charging. 
The charging unit moves up to twice its normal speed and 
ends up with at least one token in a square adjacent to an 
opposing unit or singular creature. At the end of the move, 
it makes a melee attack (refer to “Melee attack” below). 
The unit has advantage on the attack, 
Unit Combat Actions 
Dash: Rather than performing any other action, the unit 
spends the entire round moving. This allows the unit to 
move twice as far this round. It is effectively a double move 
action. 
Disengage: When two units are engaged in melee combat, 
either unit can, on its initiative, use its move action t move 
away from the other. A unit may not perform any other 
combat action this round. 
Regroup: Once a battle progresses, units can be worn 
down pretty fast. Sometimes it is advantageous to regroup 
two or more partially depleted units into one full one. As 
long as the units have similar specs, a unit can move up to 
its speed to come into contact with the other one. Revise 
the unit specs as required and add up the total number of 
hit points. Divide the number of hit points by the number of 
hit points per token (rounding up) to determine the number 
of tokens in this new unit. You may change the unit’s 
formation as desired. The new unit takes the initiative slot 
occupied by the unit whose action created the new unit. 
Split Up: There may come a time where one unit needs to 
separate into two units. Use this action to move some of 
the Tokens away from the others. Revise the number of hit 
points for each group. You may change both unit’s 
formations as desired. The new unit takes an initiative slot 
one less than the original unit. Any singular creature that is 
in the original unit can select which unit it wishes to stay 
with. A unit can divide as often as desired, but no unit can 
divide more than once in one round. A unit may move 
before it splits, or is can split first and then both new units 
can move. 
Attack - Melee: Whenever a unit makes a melee attack 
against another unit, one or more tokens of the attacking 
unit must be in a square that has one of its 4 sides 
touching one of the 4 sides of a token in the other unit. 
Or, if the unit is attacking a singular creature, at least one 
token must be adjacent to the square that contains the 
singular creature. Or, the singular creature that it is 
attacking must be inside the attacking unit.  
Attack - Range: If the unit has range weapons and it is 
within the maximum range of an opposing unit or singular 
creature it can make a ranged attack. It cannot make a 
ranged attack unless there is at least one open square 
between the tokens in its unit and the opponent’s square. 
No unit can attack with range weapons on the same round 
that it makes a melee attack. It is important to observe the 
standard rules governing range. Calculate the range as the 
closest distance between the opponents squares measured 
in feet, not in squares.  
Cast a Spell: Refer to “Units Casting Spells” in chapter 6. 
Set against Charge: If the unit is carrying appropriate reach 
weapons, they may use their unit action to set against a 
charge. The unit can keep this defensive status until it 
moves or performs another unit action. This action guards 
against charging attacks from all sides. When set against a 
charge, if a foe charges them, the opponents make an 
opposed Dexterity save. If the charging unit or singular 
creature wins the opposed check, it continues with its 
attack at a disadvantage. If the unit that is set against the 
charge wins, it uses a reflex action to make an attack 
against the charging unit with advantage using its reach 
weapons. If the charging unit is successfully repelled, it 
remains in adjacent squares and may not attack again until 
the following round. 
Form a Phalanx Formation: A unit armed with shields may 
use this unit action to raise their shields above their heads 
to protect themselves from range attacks at the cost of 
speed and attack capability. After forming the phalanx the 
unit may maintain this defense while performing other 
actions, except as noted. The unit’s move rate is reduced 
by half (to a minimum of 1 square). A phalanx formation 
imposes disadvantage on all ranged attacks made against 
it. A unit in phalanx formation cannot charge. A unit in 
phalanx formation cannot attack with range weapons. As 
long as they maintain the phalanx formation they can only 
engage in melee with reach weapons and they have 
disadvantage on those attacks. A Phalanx Formation also 
protects any NPCs or PCs in a unit but it prevents them 
from making any attacks. On any round after forming the 
phalanx formation the unit may set against a charge and 
maintain the phalanx formation. 
Change Formation 
Once each round, as a bonus action, the tokens that make 
up a unit can be re-arranged as desired so long as no 
token is moved further in the direction the unit is moving 
than the forward most token. This rearrangement cannot be 
used to surround an opponent that you are currently 
engaging in melee. You can use it to place more tokens 
adjacent to enemy tokens, but they cannot move farther in 
the direction of your opponent than your current most 
forward token. This will typically be to accommodate the 
shrinking size of the unit, but as long as each of the tokens 
has at least one side (not just a corner) adjacent to 
another token in the unit and there are no “holes”, the unit 
can be re-arranged as desired. No token that is currently 
engaged in melee can be moved. 
Units Attacking Multiple Targets 
A unit that is currently engaged in melee can’t charge 
another foe without first defeating, or disengaging from its 
current foe. However, it can use the “Change Formation” 
bonus action to bring additional tokens into play. Also, 
D&D Wars for the fifth edition of Dungeons and Dragons 
10 
while engaged in melee combat with one enemy, another 
enemy can attack you on another side. As many other units 
or singular creatures can attack your unit as there is room 
for one of their tokens to come up against one of yours. A 
unit may make a separate melee attack against each unit or 
singular creature that it is currently engaging it in battle. 
A unit that is not engaged in melee combat can make 
ranged attacks on multiple enemy units as long as they are 
all within range. Each token may only attack a single target 
and that target must be a unit or singular creature. Before 
attack rolls are made, declare how many tokens are firing 
and which foe they are attacking. Make a separate attack 
roll against each foe. If the attack is successful, use the 
number of tokens that were firing to determine damage. 
Taking Damage 
The Unit Hit Points are a representation of how much 
damage a unit can take before it is completely defeated. As 
tokens receive damage, that damage is spread out over 
the entire unit. Just as a PC can continue to fight until his 
hit points are reduced to 0, tokens continue to fight, each 
with 10 creatures, until the unit as a hole takes enough hit 
point damage to require the removal of a token. A unit 
reduced to zero hit points is vanquished though not all of 
its members are necessarily slain. 
Following an attack in which tokens are lost, the defender 
decides which of the tokens to remove. The tokens are an 
abstract representation of creatures remaining in the unit, 
so they are normally removed from the back side of the 
unit. If possible, you should remove tokens that are not 
engaged in melee combat. This represents the creatures in 
the rear moving forward to replace the downed creatures in 
the front.  
Inter-unit actions 
This refers to the actions of singular creatures that are in a 
unit.  
Normally the order in which they act is determined by those 
in the unit, as long as they all agree. As long as there is no 
combat between creatures that are in the unit, each 
singular creature can do anything that they could normally 
do in one round; this includes performing as many actions 
as they would normally be allowed in one (6 second) 
combat round.  
If one or more enemy creatures enters a unit and the unit 
contains no friendly singular creatures, the unit will attack 
the invading creature during this phase. If the unit contains 
friendly singular creatures and one or more enemy 
creatures enter it, secondary Initiative is rolled for all of 
the singular creatures in the unit. One round of inter-unit 
combat will be resolved before the unit takes its turn. 
All of the singular creature combatants (monsters, NPCs 
and PCs) are surrounded by the creatures that make up the 
unit. These creatures all move back to allow inter-unit 
combat. If there is room for them to do so, they will form a 
tight circle about 10 feet away from the combatants. If any 
of the creatures in a token are attacked, the unit will attack 
the enemy singular creatures, otherwise they don’t 
interfere or attack unless their allies are defeated.  
Winning the Combat 
This battle may represent only a single battle in a larger 
war. The battle is over when one side surrenders, or all of 
its units surrender or rout.  
Morale Check 
Certain conditions may require a unit to make a DC 15 
Wisdom check. Failure means that the unit has routed. The 
DM may require checks at times of severe stress such as 
when a unit is attacked by a ferocious creature, such as a 
dragon. The check is required when a unit is reduced to half 
its original number of tokens. Another check is required 
when a unit is reduced to 1/4 its original number of tokens. 
When there is only one token remaining, the unit must make 
a DC 20 Wisdom check or surrender.  
Rout 
Treat a unit that has been routed as frightened. It turns and 
flees. If it is currently engaged in melee combat with 
another unit, that unit can take a reaction to make a melee 
attack against it. The frightened unit must spend its turns 
trying to get as far away from hostile units as it can. It 
cannot take reactions, and it can use its actions only to 
Dash or to try to escape from an effect that prevents it 
from moving. A frightened unit that cannot flee drops its 
weapons and surrenders. A unit can rally by making a DC 
15 Wisdom check, which is rolled at the start of each of its 
turns. A unit that fails to be rallied for three rounds in a row 
scatters and can no longer be rallied. The unit and its 
tokens sre then no longer considered to be engaged in the 
combat. Singular creatures may, but are not required to, 
flee with units they are in. 
Surrender 
Military style battles seldom end in the total annihilation of 
the opponent’s forces. At any time, any unit or singular 
creature may choose to surrender at the start of its round. 
The surrendered combatant cannot move or attempt any 
other actions that round. If the surrender is accepted, the 
battle is over for those creatures. If they are attacked, the 
attack is made with advantage, and the battle continues. 
How the creatures on the losing side are treated is up to 
you. 
Recovering Casualties 
Unit Hit Points do not track actual deaths in a unit. They are 
more a measure of its ability to keep fighting through 
individual death, injury and surrender. At the end of each 
By Ronny Hart—January 2015 
11 
battle, a percentage of the lost hit points may be 
automatically recovered as those injured are helped, those 
who ran come out of hiding and the death toll is finally 
tallied. At the end of any battle, the victor may recover 
50% and the defeated side may recover 25% of lost Unit 
Hit Points. 
Chapter 6 – Magic 
Spell Ranges 
Touch Spells: A spell with a range of touch requires the 
caster be in physical contact with the target of the spell. 
The square occupied by the caster must be in contact with 
the square containing the target. 
Other ranges: Ranges are calculated as the distance in feet 
between the square containing the caster and the target 
Spell Targets 
Singular creatures as targets: The effects of a spell on a 
singular creature follows standard D&D 5E rules regarding 
spell effects. Singular creatures in a unit may not be the 
target of a spell. This means that if a singular creature is in 
a unit, it is safe from targeted spells, but may still be 
affected by area of effect spells. The exception to this is if 
the caster of the spell is also in that same unit.  
Units as targets: A unit cannot be the target of a spell 
unless the spell causes Hit Point damage, or if it is an area 
of effect spell. 
Area of Effect Spells Cast on Units 
For area of effect spells cast on units, rather than trying to 
lay out the area on the grid, you can instead determine the 
maximum number of creatures the spell could cover. For a 
line, draw a line of the correct length on the grid. For other 
shapes you can lay it out on a 5 ft. grid and count all of the 
squares that have their center inside the area of effect. An 
easier method that gives reasonable results is this: 
For Circular areas of effect, divide the radius by 5, square 
that number and then multiply the result by 3. For example: 
If the spell covers a 15 ft. radius. 15/5 = 3, 3 squared = 
9, 9x3=27, therefore a 15 ft. radius area of effect spell 
could affect up to 27 medium or small creatures. 
For Cone areas of effect, divide the number above by 4. 
For Tiny creatures multiply the number affected by 4. 
For Large creatures divide by 4, for Huge divide by 9, for 
Gargantuan or larger divide by 16.   
Regardless of the calculations, the spell will always affect at 
least one creature. 
Spell Types 
Spells that cause Hit Point damage: For spells that do Hit 
Point damage that are cast on a unit, calculate the total 
number of hit points damage that would be inflicted on all of 
the creatures in the area of effect and apply that to the 
entire unit. 
Heal Spells: For area of effect heal spells that are cast on a 
unit. Calculate the total number of hit points that would be 
healed on all of the creatures in the area of effect and 
apply that to the entire unit. Example: A spellcaster casts a 
Mass Cure Wounds spell on a unit. He rolls and determines 
that he heals 31 hit points of damage on all creatures in a 
25 foot radius. If the unit consists of medium size 
creatures there will be 75 creatures in the area (refer to 
“Area of Effect Spells Cast on Units” on how to calculate 
this). Multiplying the 31 hit points by the 75 creatures = 
2,326 total hit point’s healed. So in this case 2,326 
points are added back to the units remaining hit points. Of 
course the units hit point total (and number of tokens in the 
unit) can’t exceed its original amount. The area of effect 
cannot cure more creatures than the total number of 
creatures in the unit (original number of Tokens x 10). 
Whenever the hit points healed equals or exceeds one 
token’s hit points, another token is added back to the unit. 
These represent wounded creatures getting up and 
rejoining the battle. If possible, the new Tokens should not 
be placed adjacent to existing enemy Tokens. 
Other type spells: For area of effect spells cast on units 
that buff, heal, hinder movement, penalize, harm, confuse, 
or take opponents out of the fight - calculate the total 
number of creatures in the area of effect, then divide the 
total by 10. This is the number of Tokens that are affected 
by the spell. If the spell doesn’t affect the entire unit, the 
unaffected Tokens perform the “Split Up” action as a 
reaction and can leave the affected Tokens as a separate 
unit.  
Collateral Damage 
If one or more monsters, NPCs or PCs are in a unit when it 
is attacked by an area of effect spell, they may also be 
affected. If the spell’s area of effect includes all of the 
unit’s tokens, these singular creatures must also make 
saving throws, or be affected by the spell as normal. 
Turning Undead  
Use the above rules to determine the number of undead 
affected and the number of tokens that represents. The 
affected tokens rout, scatter and cannot be rallied. 
Singular Creatures Casting Spells 
Singular creatures (monsters, PCs and NPCs) cast spells in 
D&D Wars as per the standard rules regarding spell casting 
except as noted above. 
D&D Wars for the fifth edition of Dungeons and Dragons 
12 
Units Casting Spells 
[In most D&D settings, magic is rare enough to make having 
a unit filled with magic users extremely unlikely. All of the 
magic spells cast in battle will be from individual monsters, 
NPCs or PCs. However, this is fantasy after all - so you 
may need these rules.] 
All of the rules above apply except as indicated below.  
• The target’s saving throw is made at a disadvantage.  
• Every creature in the unit must be capable of casting the 
same spell at the same level.  
• Only one spell (the same spell) can be cast in a single 
round. 
• The target can only be one unit, or one singular creature, 
or if it is an area of effect spell it can target the PCs squad 
if the squad is not in a unit. It may be that not all tokens in 
the unit will be able to cast the spell. Tokens in the front 
ranks block line of site for the tokens behind them. The 
casting tokens must each be within range and have line of 
sight to the target square. Even if the tokens do not all 
cast the spell, the entire unit loses this spell slot, and the 
other tokens cannot perform any other actions in this 
round. When a unit cast a spell, each participating token 
targets a specific token in the other unit or they all target 
the square containing a singular creature. If attacking 
another unit, each token that is casting a spell must target 
a different token. Only those tokens that have a target can 
cast the spell. It may often be the case that some tokens 
are within range and others are not. 
Units casting Area of Effect Spells 
If an area of effect spell is cast by a unit, determine the 
maximum number of tokens in the spell casting unit that have 
line of site and are within range of the target. The spell is 
only cast by that number of tokens. Use the method 
describe earlier for determining the hit punt damage, or 
number of affected tokens and then multiply by the number 
of tokens that are casting the spell.  
Proportional Saves (Optional Rule) 
Using the standard rules, all of the creatures in a unit either 
make their saving throw or they all fail. This is in keeping 
with the standard D&D combat rules, but may produce 
unsatisfactory results. Rather than having the unit make a 
saving throw, you may use this method of calculating the 
number of effected tokens. Subtract the appropriate saving 
throw bonus from the DC of the saving throw and multiply 
the total by five. The result is the percentage of the tokens 
in the area of effect that failed their saving throws. At least 
5% will always fail, and at most 95%. [This calculates the 
average number of creatures in the affected area that would 
have failed the save and applies that result to the unit.] 
Chapter 7 - War Machines 
At the beginning of the battle, siege weapons and other 
devises must be placed in outlying units as far from the 
structure that they are intended to assault as possible. 
Units and singular creatures can attack siege weapons or 
siege towers using the rules for attacking singular 
creatures, even though it is located in a unit. 
Siege Weapons 
Massive weapons of war, siege weapons allow the 
destruction of fortifications. Refer to the Dungeon 
Master’s Guide for detailed siege equipment descriptions. 
Siege weapons do damage to units or singular creatures 
using the range attack rules for singular creatures attacking 
units or creatures. They do damage to structures or other 
siege weapons using the rules for creatures attacking 
creatures. 
Range  
Ranges for war machines work exactly as for normal ranged 
combat. Catapults and Trebuchets can’t target anything 
closer than half their normal range.  
Size 
This is the space required to operate this weapon. There 
can be no more than one siege weapon in any square on 
the battle grid.   
Rate of Fire 
This is how many actions the crew must expend to fire and 
reload the war machine. 
Crew 
This is the minimum number of crew required to load and 
fire the weapon. 
Siege Weapon Units 
A unit that contains a siege weapon is a separate unit type. 
It is a standard unit in all ways with the following 
exceptions: 
• The most obvious exception is that the unit contains a 
siege weapon. A unit can contain only one siege weapon. 
The figure that represents the siege weapon can sit on top 
of one of the unit’s Tokens. 
• Singular creatures can be in siege weapon units, just as 
they can in standard units. 
• If the siege weapon is destroyed the unit must to make a 
DC 15 Wisdom check. Failure means that the unit has 
routed. If it doesn’t rout, it becomes a standard unit. 
• A siege weapon unit cannot have fewer creatures than the 
minimum number required to operate the weapon, but it can 
have more. Most units are no larger than required to move, 
By Ronny Hart—January 2015 
13 
operate and protect the siege weapon. The unit will 
typically contain just one token. 
• The unit should consist of trained siege weapon 
operators; otherwise the siege weapon will be fired at a 
disadvantage. 
• A siege weapon unit moves at a speed of 15 feet per 
round and cannot use the Dash action. It can’t load or fire 
the weapon on any round that it moves. Neither can it 
attack with personal weapons. 
• The unit’s Hit Points are separate from the siege weapon 
Hit Points. Singular creatures and units can target the unit 
or target the siege weapon. 
• In addition to the siege weapon, the unit tokens will 
normally have weapons as well. These are used to protect 
the siege weapon. Any round that the unit tokens attack 
with these personal weapons cannot be used for loading or 
for firing the siege weapon.  
• Any round that the unit is loading or firing the siege 
weapon counts as a unit attack action. The tokens not 
directly involved in loading or firing the weapon can take a 
total defense action which affects the entire unit. 
• A unit that contains a siege weapon cannot charge. 
• A siege weapon unit can set against a charge but cannot 
form a phalanx formation. The unit can maintain this set 
against a charge and still load and fire the weapon as long 
as there are enough creatures in the unit to circle the 
siege weapon and still leave the minimum number of 
creatures required to operate the weapon. 
• Siege weapon units can move through allied units, but not 
through enemy units. 
Siege Towers 
This device is a massive wooden tower on wheels or rollers 
that can be rolled up against a wall to allow attackers to 
scale the tower and thus get to the top of the wall with 
cover. The top of the siege tower contains a drawbridge 
capable of dropping down at various heights onto the 
battlements once moved to an adjacent square. The 
wooden walls of the tower are usually 1 foot thick and 
covered with padded rawhide for fireproofing. They have an 
AC of 15 and 200 hit points. The siege tower stands 78 
feet tall and is 15 feet wide at its base. It can hold a 
maximum of 50 Medium or Small creatures. Medium or 
smaller creatures can use the siege tower to reach the top 
of walls up to 40 feet high. 
Siege Tower Units 
A unit that contains a siege tower is a separate unit type. It 
is a standard unit in all ways with the following exceptions: 
• The entire unit is contained within the siege tower. 
• Siege tower units have disadvantage to their initiative. 
• A siege tower unit starts out with 50 medium or small 
creatures, represented by 5 tokens (stacked). 
• The siege tower occupies one square on the battle matt. 
The unit tokens can be stacked, all members of the unit 
reside within the tower. 
• The creatures represented by the token on bottom move 
the tower, the other Tokens can fire arrows through narrow 
arrow slits (at a disadvantage to attack rolls). They can fire 
on 4 different targets, as long as each target is on a 
different side of the tower. Each of the 4 targets can be 
fired at by one token. 
• If the siege tower is destroyed the unit must to make a 
DC 15 Wisdom check. Failure means that the unit has 
routed. If it doesn’t rout, it becomes a standard unit. 
• A siege tower unit moves at a rate of 15 feet every 
other round (the distance that a siege tower can be moved 
in two rounds). The Tokens in the unit can’t attack on any 
round that the tower is moving. 
• The unit’s Hit Points are separate from the siege towers 
Hit Points. Singular creature and unit attacks can target the 
unit at a disadvantage, or target the siege tower itself. 
• A siege tower unit cannot charge. 
• A siege tower unit can move through allied units, but not 
through enemy units. 
• If unopposed, the siege tower unit can lower the towers 
drawbridge and exit onto a fortified wall beginning on the 
round after it enters an adjacent square. The Tokens in the 
tower can exit onto the wall as a rate of 10 creatures (one 
token) per round. Surrounding units can then use the tower 
as a covered stairway to climb the wall at this same rate. 
• Once the tower is in place and the drawbridge lowered, 
the siege tower unit becomes a standard unit. 
Battering Rams 
A ram is typically 15 feet long. It takes at least one Huge 
or larger creatures, two Large creatures, four Medium 
creatures, or eight Small creatures to operate a ram. Ram. 
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one object. 
Hit: 16 (3d10) bludgeoning damage.  
Battering Ram Units 
Battering rams are normally kept at the rear of the army 
with other supplies and brought forward only when needed. 
At that time, a few creatures leave the most forward unit 
and form a battering ram unit that contains only enough 
creatures to carry and swing the ram. This new unit 
occupies one square and has an initiative one less than the 
unit it came from. This unit has only two actions available to 
it in a round. It can move with the ram at its standard move 
rate, or it can attack an adjacent structure with the ram. A 
battering ram unit cannot carry shields and receives no 
dexterity bonus to its armor class. 
D&D Wars for the fifth edition of Dungeons and Dragons 
14 
Chapter 8 - Optional rules 
for larger or smaller battles 
The standard rules for D&D Wars use a 1 inch square grid 
where each square represents a game space of 15 ft. on a 
side and each army is made up of units that all start out 
with 20 tokens in a unit with 10 creatures in each token. 
You may want to play a game with larger or smaller armies 
than these rules can easily accommodate. You can easily 
use the standard rules but change the number of tokens in 
a unit. The default number of Tokens in a unit is 20. 
Adjusting this number up or down may be all that is 
necessary for the battle you envision, but there may be 
situations where changing the number of creatures in each 
token provides a better solution. To do this and not 
change the size of the tokens, you will need to change how 
much space each 1 in. square represents on the grid. For 
very small battles each square could represent 5 ft. For 
larger battles they could represent 25 ft., 50 ft., 100 ft., 
or 200 ft.  
The battle matt still has one inch squares and the token 
sizes vary depending on the creature size as in the 
standard D&D Wars rules. The primary change is how many 
creatures are in one token and what size the 1 in. square 
represents.  
Once a scale is selected, all units use the same scale for 
the duration of the battle. 
The Unit’s Hit Points 
For the minimum hit points per token, multiply the number of 
creatures in a token by the hit points of one creature.  For 
the starting hit pints for a unit multiply the hit points per 
token by the number of tokens in the unit. 
 
 
Optional Variant - Lower Hit Points  
For some battles, the number of hit points in a unit can 
become very large. To make the math easier, you may want 
to use this variant. Instead of having the hit points for a 
token be the actual number of hit points for all of the 
creatures in the token, each token starts out with the same 
number of hit points as one typical creature in that unit. 
Multiply the number of hit points of one token by the 
number of tokens in the unit to determine the starting 
number of hit points for the unit as a whole. The damage a 
token inflicts when it attacks is the same damage as one 
creature. If there are no singular creatures involved in the 
battle this works out the same as it would using the 
standard rules. If there are singular creatures involved in 
the battle, any damage a singular creature inflicts on a unit 
is divided by the number of creatures in a token. And any 
damage a unit inflicts on a singular creature is multiplied by 
the number of creatures in all of the tokens involved in the 
attack.

By Ronny Hart—January 2015

Unit Sizes 
The number of creatures per unit listed for the different 
scales below are the number that would be in a typical unit 
that contains 20 tokens. You can have as many, or as few 
tokens in a unit as desired. 
Very Small; 20 creatures per unit 
This is very much the same as standard D&D 5E rules. Each 
square represents 5 ft. and each token contains only one 
creature. You may want to use this whenever PCs must 
battle a large number of creatures. Example: The PCs must 
battle a mob consisting of 12 angry peasants armed with 
torches and pitchforks. By using these rules and making the 
peasants into a unit, you could greatly decrease the 
amount of time it takes to play out the combat. 
Standard; 200 creatures per unit 
This is the standard scale for D&D Wars. All of the standard 
rules use this scale. At this scale a 1 in. square represents 
a 15 ft. by 15 ft. area and each token holds 10 creatures.  
Medium; 500 creatures per unit 
This scale would represent a clash between two kingdoms. 
At this scale a 1 in. square represents a 25 ft. by 25 ft. 
area and each token holds 25 creatures. For creatures that 
have a speed of 25 or 30, a move is 1 square, or 2 
squares for a Dash action. 
Large; 2000 creatures per unit 
This scale will only be needed for wars where Kingdoms 
unite to defeat a major threat. At this scale a 1 in. square 
represents a 50 ft. by 50 ft. area and each token holds 
100 creatures. All move actions must be Dash actions, or 
their equivalent (Pass Through, Charge, Disengage, 
Regroup). Any move action will move a unit 1 square. 
Very Large; 8,000 creatures per unit 
This scale is for history changing conflicts. It might take 
years for an alliance of kingdoms to assemble armies this 
large. At this scale a 1 in. square represents a 100 ft. by 
100 ft. area and each token holds 400 creatures. All move 
rates are doubled. ). Any move action will move a unit 1 
square. 
Epic; 32,000 creatures per unit 
This is a crazy large scale. Perhaps the entire known world 
is defending itself from invading armies from another plane. 
At this scale a 1 in. square represents a 200 ft. by 200 
ft. area and each token holds 1,600 creatures. Change 
from 6 second rounds to 1 minute rounds. Increase all 
speeds and damage by a factor of10. You can leave the 
number of attacks the same, but you may need to increase 
the range increments for range weapons. 
Non-standard Units 
If you want to have more or less creatures in a token than 
any indicated here, use the scale that could contain that 
number of creatures. Use your number of creatures per 
token in place of the number listed. Adjust the number of 
hit points per token and number of hit points per unit 
accordingly. As long as you use the same scale, your 
armies can contain any number of standard and non-
standard units, but to do so you will need to reduce the 
damage that the smaller unit tokens can do in proportion to 
their reduced number of creatures per token. (I’ll let you 
do the math.)

Preface
O
NCE UPON A TIME, LONG, LONG AGO, IN A
realm called the Midwestern United 
States—specifically the states o f Minne­
sota and W isconsin—a group of friends 
gathered together to forever alter the 
history o f gaming.
It wasn’t their intent to do so. They were 
tired of merely reading tales about worlds of magic, 
monsters, and adventure. They wanted to play in those 
worlds, rather than observe them. That they went on 
to invent D u n g e o n s  & D r a g o n s , and thereby ignite a 
revolution in gaming that continues to this day, speaks 
to two things.
First, it speaks to their ingenuity and genius in fig­
uring out that gam es w ere the perfect way to explore 
w orlds that could not otherwise exist. Alm ost every 
m odern game, whether played on a digital device or 
a tabletop, ow es som e debt to D&D.
Second, it is a testament to the inherent appeal of the 
game they created. D u n g e o n s  &  D r a g o n s  sparked a 
thriving global phenomenon. It is the first roleplaying 
game, and it remains one of the best of its breed.
To play D&D, and to play it well, you don’t need to 
read all the rules, m em orize every detail of the game, 
or master the fine art o f rolling funny looking dice.
None of those things have any bearing on what’s best 
about the game.
W hat you need are two things, the first being friends 
with whom  you can share the game. Playing games with 
your friends is a lot of fun, but D&D does som ething 
m ore than entertain.
Playing D&D is an exercise in collaborative creation. 
You and your friends create epic stories filled with ten­
sion and memorable drama. You create silly in-jokes 
that make you laugh years later. The dice will be cruel 
to you, but you will soldier on. Your collective creativ­
ity will build stories that you will tell again and again, 
ranging from the utterly absurd to the stuff of legend.
If you don’t have friends interested in playing, don’t 
worry. There’s a special alchemy that takes place 
around a D&D table that nothing else can match. Play 
the game with som eone enough, and the two of you
are likely to end up friends. It’s a cool side effect o f the 
game. Your next gaming group is as close as the nearest 
game store, online forum, or gaming convention.
The second thing you need is a lively imagination 
or, m ore importantly, the willingness to use whatever 
imagination you have. You don’t need to be a master 
storyteller or a brilliant artist. You just need to aspire to 
create, to have the courage of som eone who is willing to 
build som ething and share it with others.
Luckily, just as D&D can strengthen your friendships, 
it can help build in you the confidence to create and 
share. D&D is a game that teaches you to look for the 
clever solution, share the sudden idea that can overcom e 
a problem, and push yourself to imagine what could be, 
rather than simply accept what is.
The first characters and adventures you create will 
probably be a collection of cliches. That’s true of every­
one, from the greatest Dungeon Masters in history on 
down. Accept this reality and move on to create the 
second character or adventure, which will be better, 
and then the third, w hich will be better still. Repeat that 
over the course of time, and soon you’ll be able to create 
anything, from a character’s background story to an epic 
world of fantasy adventure.
Once you have that skill, it’s yours forever. Countless 
writers, artists, and other creators can trace their begin­
nings to a few pages o f D&D notes, a handful of dice, 
and a kitchen table.
Above all else, D&D is yours. The friendships you 
make around the table will be unique to you. The adven­
tures you embark on, the characters you create, the 
m em ories you make—these will be yours. D&D is your 
personal corner of the universe, a place where you have 
free reign to do as you wish.
G o forth now. Read the rules of the game and the 
story of its worlds, but always remember that you are 
the one who brings them to life. They are nothing 
without the spark of life that you give them.

In t r o d u c t io n
Th
e D u n g e o n s  &  D r a g o n s  r o le p la y in g 
game is about storytelling in w orlds of 
sw ords and sorcery. It shares elements 
with childhood games of make-believe. Like 
those games, D & D  is driven by imagina­
tion. It’s about picturing the towering castle 
beneath the stormy night sky and imagining 
how a fantasy adventurer might react to the challenges 
that scene presents.
Dungeon Master (DM): After passing through the 
craggy peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east 
and Castle Ravenloft towers before you. Crumbling 
towers of stone keep a silent watch over the approach. 
They look like abandoned guardhouses. Beyond these, 
a wide chasm gapes, disappearing into the deep 
fog below. A lowered drawbridge spans the chasm, 
leading to an arched entrance to the castle courtyard.
The chains of the drawbridge creak in the wind, their 
rust-eaten iron straining with the weight. From atop 
the high strong walls, stone gargoyles stare at you 
from hollow sockets and grin hideously. A rotting 
wooden portcullis, green with growth, hangs in the 
entry tunnel. Beyond this, the main doors of Castle 
Ravenloft stand open, a rich warm light spilling into 
the courtyard.
Phillip (playing Gareth): I want to look at the 
gargoyles. I have a feeling they’re not just statues.
Amy (playing Riva): The drawbridge looks precarious?
I want to see how sturdy it is. Do I think we can cross 
it, or is it going to collapse under our weight?
Unlike a game of make-believe, D&D gives structure 
to the stories, a way of determining the consequences 
of the adventurers’ action. Players roll dice to resolve 
whether their attacks hit or m iss or whether their adven­
turers can scale a cliff, roll away from the strike of a 
m agical lightning bolt, or pull off som e other dangerous 
task. Anything is possible, but the dice make som e out­
com es m ore probable than others.
Dungeon Master (DM): OK, one at a time. Phillip, 
you’re looking at the gargoyles?
Phillip: Yeah. Is there any hint they might be 
creatures and not decorations?
DM: Make an Intelligence check.
Phillip: Does my Investigation skill apply?
DM: Sure!
Phillip (rolling a d20): Ugh. Seven.
DM: They look like decorations to you. And Amy,
Riva is checking out the drawbridge?
In the D u n g e o n s  & D r a g o n s  game, each player 
creates an adventurer (also called a character) and 
teams up with other adventurers (played by friends). 
W orking together, the group might explore a dark dun­
geon, a ruined city, a haunted castle, a lost temple deep 
in a jungle, or a lava-filled cavern beneath a mysterious 
mountain. The adventurers can solve puzzles, talk with 
other characters, battle fantastic monsters, and discover 
fabulous magic items and other treasure.
One player, however, takes on the role of the Dungeon 
Master (DM), the gam e’s lead storyteller and referee. 
The DM creates adventures for the characters, who nav­
igate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The 
DM might describe the entrance to Castle Ravenloft, 
and the players decide what they want their adventurers 
to do. Will they walk across the dangerously weathered 
drawbridge? Tie themselves together with rope to mini­
m ize the chance that som eone will fall if the drawbridge 
gives way? Or cast a spell to carry them over the chasm?
Then the DM determines the results of the adventur­
ers’ actions and narrates what they experience. Because 
the DM can improvise to react to anything the players 
attempt, D&D is infinitely flexible, and each adventure 
can be exciting and unexpected.
The game has no real end; when one story or quest 
wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing 
story called a campaign. Many people who play the 
game keep their cam paigns going for months or years, 
meeting with their friends every week or so to pick 
up the story where they left off. The adventurers grow 
in might as the campaign continues. Each monster 
defeated, each adventure completed, and each treasure 
recovered not only adds to the continuing story, but also 
earns the adventurers new capabilities. This increase 
in power is reflected by an adventurer’s level.
There’s no winning and losing in the D u n g e o n s  &  
D r a g o n s  game—at least, not the way those terms are 
usually understood. Together, the D M  and the players 
create an exciting story of bold adventurers who confront 
deadly perils. Som etim es an adventurer might com e to 
a grisly end, torn apart by ferocious monsters or done in 
by a nefarious villain. Even so, the other adventurers can 
search for powerful magic to revive their fallen comrade, 
or the player might choose to create a new character to 
carry on. The group might fail to complete an adventure 
successfully, but if everyone had a good time and created 
a memorable story, they all win.
W o r ld s of A d v e n t u r e
The many worlds of the D u n g e o n s  & D r a g o n s  game 
are places o f magic and monsters, of brave warriors and 
spectacular adventures. They begin with a foundation 
of medieval fantasy and then add the creatures, places, 
and magic that make these worlds unique.
The worlds of the D u n g e o n s  &  D r a g o n s  game exist 
within a vast cosm os called the multiverse, connected 
in strange and mysterious ways to one another and to 
other planes of existence, such as the Elemental Plane 
of Fire and the Infinite Depths of the Abyss. Within
this multiverse are an endless variety of worlds. Many 
of them have been published as official settings for the 
D&D game. The legends of the Forgotten Realms, Drag- 
onlance, Greyhawk, Dark Sun, Mystara, and Eberron 
settings are woven together in the fabric of the multi- 
verse. Alongside these worlds are hundreds of thousands 
more, created by generations of D&D players for their 
own games. And amid all the richness of the multiverse, 
you might create a world of your own.
All these worlds share characteristics, but each world 
is set apart by its own history and cultures, distinctive 
monsters and races, fantastic geography, ancient dun­
geons, and schem ing villains. Som e races have unusual 
traits in different worlds. The halflings of the Dark Sun 
setting, for example, are jungle-dwelling cannibals, 
and the elves are desert nomads. Som e worlds feature 
races unknown in other settings, such as Eberron’s war- 
forged, soldiers created and im bued with life to fight in 
the Last War. Som e worlds are dominated by one great 
story, like the War of the Lance that plays a central role 
in the Dragonlance setting. But they’re all D&D worlds, 
and you can use the rules in this book to create a char­
acter and play in any one of them.
Your DM might set the campaign on one of these 
worlds or on one that he or she created. Because there 
is so much diversity am ong the worlds of D&D, you 
should check with your DM about any house rules that 
will affect your play of the game. Ultimately, the Dun­
geon Master is the authority on the campaign and its 
setting, even if the setting is a published world.
U s in g T h is B o o k
The Player’s Handbook is divided into three parts.
Part 1 is about creating a character, providing the 
rules and guidance you need to make the character 
you’ll play in the game. It includes information on the 
various races, classes, backgrounds, equipment, and 
other customization options that you can choose from. 
Many of the rules in part 1 rely on material in parts 2 
and 3. If you com e across a game concept in part 1 that 
you don’t understand, consult the book’s index.
Part 2 details the rules of how to play the game, 
beyond the basics described in this introduction. That 
part covers the kinds of die rolls you make to determine 
success or failure at the tasks your character attempts, 
and describes the three broad categories o f activity in 
the game: exploration, interaction, and combat.
Part 3 is all about magic. It covers the nature of magic 
in the worlds of D&D, the rules for spellcasting, and the 
huge variety o f spells available to magic-using charac­
ters (and monsters) in the game.
How t o  Pl a y
The play of the D u n g e o n s  & D r a g o n s  game unfolds 
according to this basic pattern.
1. The DM describes the environment. The DM
tells the players where their adventurers are and what’s 
around them, presenting the basic scope of options that 
present themselves (how many doors lead out of a room, 
what’s on a table, w ho’s in the tavern, and so on).
2. The players describe what they want to do. S om e­
times one player speaks for the whole party, saying, 
“W e’ll take the east door,” for example. Other times, 
different adventurers do different things: one adventurer 
might search a treasure chest while a second exam ines 
an esoteric sym bol engraved on a wall and a third keeps 
watch for monsters. The players don’t need to take 
turns, but the DM listens to every player and decides 
how to resolve those actions.
Som etim es, resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer 
wants to walk across a room  and open a door, the DM 
might just say that the door opens and describe what 
lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor 
might hide a deadly trap, or som e other circum stance 
might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete 
a task. In those cases, the DM decides what happens, 
often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results 
of an action.
3. The DM narrates the results of 
the adventurers’ 
actions. Describing the results often leads to another 
decision point, which brings the flow of the game right 
back to step 1.
This pattern holds whether the adventurers are cau­
tiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious prince, or 
locked in mortal combat against a mighty dragon. In 
certain situations, particularly combat, the action is 
m ore structured and the players (and DM) do take turns 
choosing and resolving actions. But m ost of the time, 
play is fluid and flexible, adapting to the circum stances 
of the adventure.
Often the action of an adventure takes place in the 
imagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM ’s 
verbal descriptions to set the scene. Som e DMs like to 
use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the 
m ood, and many players and DMs alike adopt different 
voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other 
characters they play in the game. Som etim es, a DM 
might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures 
to represent each creature involved in a scene to help 
the players keep track of where everyone is.
G a m e  D i c e  
The game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers 
of sides. You can find dice like these in game stores and 
in many bookstores.
In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the 
letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d 10, 
d 12, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the 
typical cube that many gam es use).
Percentile dice, or d 100, work a little differently. You 
generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two 
different ten-sided dice num bered from 0 to 9. One die 
(designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and 
the other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for 
example, the number rolled is 71. Two Os represent 100. 
Som e ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, 
and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit 
from the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, 
and 00 and 0 is 100.
W hen you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how 
many dice to roll o f a certain type, as well as what m od­
ifiers to add. For example, “3d8 + 5 ” means you roll
three eight-sided dice, add them together, and add 5 
to the total.
The sam e d notation appears in the expressions “1d3” 
and “1d2.” To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll a d6 and 
divide the num ber rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate 
the roll of 1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll 
depending on whether it w as odd or even. (Alternatively, 
if the number rolled is m ore than half the number of 
sides on the die, it’s a 2.)
T h e  D 2 0  
D oes an adventurer’s sword swing hurt a dragon or just 
bounce off its iron-hard scales? Will the ogre believe an 
outrageous bluff? Can a character swim  across a raging 
river? Can a character avoid the main blast of a fireball, 
or does he or she take full damage from the blaze? In 
cases w here the outcom e of an action is uncertain, 
the D u n g e o n s  &  D r a g o n s  game relies on rolls o f a 
20-sided die, a d20, to determine success or failure.
Every character and monster in the game has capa­
bilities defined by six ability scores. The abilities are 
Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, W isdom, 
and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 
for m ost adventurers. (Monsters might have scores as 
low as 1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the 
ability modifiers derived from  them, are the basis for 
almost every d20 roll that a player m akes on a charac­
ter’s or monster’s behalf.
Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the 
three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the 
rules of the game. All three follow these simple steps.
1. Roll the die and add a modifier. Roll a d20 and 
add the relevant modifier. This is typically the m od­
ifier derived from  one of the six ability scores, and it 
som etim es includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a char­
acter’s particular skill. (See chapter 1 for details on each 
ability and how to determine an ability’s modifier.)
2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties. A 
class feature, a spell, a particular circum stance, or som e 
other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.
3. 
Compare the total to a target number. If the total 
equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, 
attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise, it’s 
a failure. The DM is usually the one w ho determines 
target numbers and tells players whether their ability 
checks, attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.
The target number for an ability check or a saving 
throw is called a Difficulty Class (DC). The target 
number for an attack roll is called an Armor Class (AC).
This simple rule governs the resolution of m ost tasks 
in D&D play. Chapter 7 provides m ore detailed rules for 
using the d20 in the game.
A d v a n t a g e  a n d  D i s a d v a n t a g e
Som etim es an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw 
is modified by special situations called advantage and 
disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive circum ­
stances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage 
reflects the opposite. W hen you have either advantage or 
disadvantage, you roll a second d20 w hen you make the 
roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advan­
tage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage.
For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and 
a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll 
those numbers, you use the 17.
More detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage 
are presented in chapter 7.
S p e c i f i c  B e a t s  G e n e r a l
This book contains rules, especially in parts 2 and 3, 
that govern how  the game plays. That said, many racial 
traits, class features, spells, magic items, monster abili­
ties, and other game elements break the general rules in 
som e way, creating an exception to how  the rest o f the 
game works. Rem em ber this: If a specific rule contra­
dicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.
Exceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance, 
many adventurers don’t have proficiency with longbows, 
but every w ood elf does because of a racial trait. That 
trait creates a m inor exception in the game. Other 
examples of rule-breaking are m ore conspicuous. For 
instance, an adventurer can’t normally pass through 
walls, but som e spells make that possible. Magic 
accounts for m ost o f the major exceptions to the rules.
R o u n d  D o w n
There’s one m ore general rule you need to know at the 
outset. W henever you divide a number in the game, 
round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the 
fraction is one-half or greater.
A d v e n t u r e s
The D u n g e o n s  & D r a g o n s  game consists of a group 
of characters embarking on an adventure that the Dun­
geon Master presents to them. Each character brings 
particular capabilities to the adventure in the form of 
ability scores and skills, class features, racial traits, 
equipment, and magic items. Every character is dif­
ferent, with various strengths and w eaknesses, so the 
best party of adventurers is one in which the characters 
complem ent each other and cover the w eaknesses of
their com panions. The adventurers must cooperate to 
successfully complete the adventure.
The adventure is the heart of the game, a story with 
a beginning, a middle, and an end. An adventure might 
be created by the Dungeon Master or purchased off the 
shelf, tweaked and modified to suit the DM ’s needs and 
desires. In either case, an adventure features a fantastic 
setting, whether it’s an underground dungeon, a crum ­
bling castle, a stretch of wilderness, or a bustling city.
It features a rich cast o f characters: the adventurers 
created and played by the other players at the table, 
as well as nonplayer characters (NPCs). Those char­
acters might be patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or 
just background extras in an adventure. Often, one of 
the NPCs is a villain w hose agenda drives much of an 
adventure’s action.
Over the course of their adventures, the characters 
are confronted by a variety of creatures, objects, and 
situations that they must deal with in som e way. S om e­
times the adventurers and other creatures do their 
best to kill or capture each other in combat. At other 
times, the adventurers talk to another creature (or even 
a magical object) with a goal in mind. And often, the 
adventurers spend time trying to solve a puzzle, bypass 
an obstacle, find som ething hidden, or unravel the cur­
rent situation. Meanwhile, the adventurers explore the 
world, making decisions about which way to travel and 
what they’ll try to do next.
Adventures vary in length and complexity. A short 
adventure might present only a few challenges, and 
it might take no m ore than a single game session to 
complete. A long adventure can involve hundreds of 
combats, interactions, and other challenges, and take 
dozens o f sessions to play through, stretching over 
weeks or months of real time. Usually, the end of an 
adventure is marked by the adventurers heading back to 
civilization to rest and enjoy the spoils of their labors.
But that’s not the end of the story. You can think of 
an adventure as a single episode of a TV series, made 
up of multiple exciting scenes. A campaign is the whole 
series—a string o f adventures joined together, with a 
consistent group of adventurers following the narrative 
from start to finish.
T h e  T h r e e  P i l l a r s  o f  A d v e n t u r e
Adventurers can try to do anything their players can 
imagine, but it can be helpful to talk about their activ­
ities in three broad categories: exploration, social 
interaction, and combat.
Exploration includes both the adventurers’ movement 
through the world and their interaction with objects and 
situations that require their attention. Exploration is the 
give-and-take of the players describing what they want 
their characters to do, and the Dungeon Master telling 
the players what happens as a result. On a large scale, 
that might involve the characters spending a day cross­
ing a rolling plain or an hour making their way through 
caverns underground. On the sm allest scale, it could 
mean one character pulling a lever in a dungeon room  to 
see what happens.
Social interaction features the adventurers talking to 
som eone (or som ething) else. It might mean demanding
that a captured scout reveal the secret entrance to the 
goblin lair, getting information from  a rescued prisoner, 
pleading for mercy from an orc chieftain, or persuading 
a talkative magic m irror to show  a distant location to 
the adventurers.
The rules in chapters 7 and 8 support exploration and 
social interaction, as do many class features in chapter 3 
and personality traits in chapter 4.
Combat, the focus of chapter 9, involves characters 
and other creatures swinging weapons, casting spells, 
maneuvering for position, and so on—all in an effort 
to defeat their opponents, whether that means killing 
every enemy, taking captives, or forcing a rout. Combat 
is the most structured element o f a D&D session, with 
creatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets 
a chance to act. Even in the context of a pitched battle, 
there’s still plenty of opportunity for adventurers to 
attempt wacky stunts like surfing down a flight of stairs 
on a shield, to examine the environment (perhaps by 
pulling a mysterious lever), and to interact with other 
creatures, including allies, enem ies, and neutral parties.
T h e  W o n d e r s  o f  M a g i c
Few D&D adventures end without som ething magical 
happening. W hether helpful or harmful, magic appears 
frequently in the life of an adventurer, and it is the focus 
of chapters 10 and 11.
In the worlds of D u n g e o n s  &  D r a g o n s , practitioners 
of magic are rare, set apart from  the m asses o f people 
by their extraordinary talent. Com m on folk might see 
evidence of magic on a regular basis, but it’s usually 
m inor—a fantastic monster, a visibly answered prayer, 
a wizard walking through the streets with an animated 
shield guardian as a bodyguard.
For adventurers, though, magic is key to their sur­
vival. Without the healing magic of clerics and paladins, 
adventurers would quickly succum b to their wounds. 
Without the uplifting magical support of bards and 
clerics, warriors might be overwhelmed by powerful 
foes. Without the sheer magical power and versatility 
of wizards and druids, every threat w ould be mag­
nified tenfold.
Magic is also a favored tool of villains. Many adven­
tures are driven by the machinations of spellcasters 
w ho are hellbent on using magic for som e ill end. A cult 
leader seeks to awaken a god w ho slum bers beneath 
the sea, a hag kidnaps youths to magically drain them 
o f their vigor, a mad wizard labors to invest an army of 
automatons with a facsimile of life, a dragon begins a 
mystical ritual to rise up as a god of destruction—these 
are just a few of the magical threats that adventurers 
might face. With magic o f their own, in the form  of 
spells and magic items, the adventurers might prevail!
C h a p t e r  1: St e p - b y-S te p C h a r a c t e r s
 
OUR FIRST STEP IN PLAYING AN ADVENTURER IN THE
 
D u n g e o n s  &  D r a g o n s  game is to imagine
 
and create a character of your own. Your
 
character is a combination of game statistics, 
roleplaying hooks, and your imagination. You 
choose a race (such as human or halfling) and
a class (such as fighter or wizard). You also
invent the personality, appearance, and backstory of 
your character. Once completed, your character serves 
as your representative in the game, your avatar in the 
D u n g e o n s  &  D r a g o n s  world.
Before you dive into step 1 below, think about the 
kind o f adventurer you want to play. You might be a 
courageous fighter, a skulking rogue, a fervent cleric, or 
a flamboyant wizard. Or you might be m ore interested 
in an unconventional character, such as a brawny rogue 
who likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who 
picks off enem ies from  afar. D o you like fantasy fiction 
featuring dwarves or elves? Try building a character of 
one of those races. D o you want your character to be the 
toughest adventurer at the table? Consider a class like 
barbarian or paladin. If you don’t know where else to 
begin, take a look at the illustrations in this book to see 
what catches your interest.
Once you have a character in mind, follow these steps 
in order, making decisions that reflect the character you 
want. Your conception of your character might evolve 
with each choice you make. W hat’s important is that you 
com e to the table with a character you’re excited to play.
Throughout this chapter, w e use the term character 
sheet to mean whatever you use to track your character, 
whether it’s a form al character sheet (like the one at the 
end of this book), som e form of digital record, or a piece 
of notebook paper. An official D&D character sheet is a 
fine place to start until you know  what information you 
need and how you use it during the game.
B u i l d i n g  B r u e n o r
Each step o f character creation includes an example of 
that step, with a player named Bob building his dwarf 
character, Bruenor.
1. C h o o s e  a  R a c e
Every character belongs to a race, one of the many 
intelligent humanoid species in the D&D world. The 
most com m on player character races are dwarves, elves, 
halflings, and humans. Som e races also have subraces, 
such as mountain dwarf or w ood elf. Chapter 2 provides 
m ore information about these races, as well as the less 
widespread races of dragonborn, gnom es, half-elves, 
half-orcs, and tieflings.
The race you choose contributes to your character’s 
identity in an important way, by establishing a general 
appearance and the natural talents gained from culture 
and ancestry. Your character’s race grants particular 
racial traits, such as special senses, proficiency with 
certain w eapons or tools, proficiency in one or more 
skills, or the ability to use minor spells. These traits 
som etim es dovetail with the capabilities of certain
classes (see step 2). For example, the racial traits of 
lightfoot halflings make them exceptional rogues, and 
high elves tend to be powerful wizards. Som etim es 
playing against type can be fun, too. Half-orc paladins 
and mountain dwarf wizards, for example, can be 
unusual but memorable characters.
Your race also increases one or m ore of your ability 
scores, which you determine in step 3. Note these 
increases and remember to apply them later.
Record the traits granted by your race on your 
character sheet. Be sure to note your starting 
languages and your base speed as well.
B u i l d i n g  B r u e n o r , St e p  1
Bob is sitting down to create his character. He decides 
that a gruff mountain dwarf fits the character he wants 
to play. He notes all the racial traits of dwarves on his 
character sheet, including his speed of 25 feet and the 
languages he knows: Com m on and Dwarvish.
2. C h o o s e a  C l a s s 
Every adventurer is a m em ber of a class. Class broadly 
describes a character’s vocation, what special talents he 
or she possesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely 
to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters, 
or engaging in a tense negotiation. The character 
classes are described in chapter 3.
Your character receives a number of benefits from 
your choice of class. Many of these benefits are class 
features—capabilities (including spellcasting) that set 
your character apart from  m em bers of other classes.
You also gain a number of proficiencies: armor, 
weapons, skills, saving throws, and som etim es tools. 
Your proficiencies define many o f the things your 
character can do particularly well, from using certain 
w eapons to telling a convincing lie.
On your character sheet, record all the features that 
your class gives you at 1st level.
L e v e l
Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances 
in level by adventuring and gaining experience points 
(XP). A 1st-level character is inexperienced in the 
adventuring world, although he or she might have been 
a soldier or a pirate and done dangerous things before.
Starting off at 1st level marks your character’s entry 
into the adventuring life. If you’re already familiar 
with the game, or if you are joining an existing D&D 
campaign, your DM might decide to have you begin at a 
higher level, on the assumption that your character has 
already survived a few harrowing adventures.
Q u i c k  B u i l d
Each class description in chapter 3 includes a section 
offering suggestions to quickly build a character of that 
class, including how to assign your highest ability scores, 
a background suitable to the class, and starting spells.
PART 1
 S TE P-B Y -STE P CHARACTERS
Record your level on your character sheet. If you’re 
starting at a higher level, record the additional elements 
your class gives you for your levels past 1st. A lso record 
your experience points. A 1st-level character has 0 
X P  A  higher-level character typically begins with the 
minim um amount of X P  required to reach that level 
(see “Beyond 1st Level” later in this chapter).
H i t  P o i n t s  a n d  H i t  D ic e
Your character’s hit points define how tough your 
character is in combat and other dangerous situations. 
Your hit points are determined by your Hit Dice (short 
for Hit Point Dice).

At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the 
die type is determined by your class. You start with hit 
points equal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in 
your class description. (You also add your Constitution 
modifier, which you’ll determine in step 3.) This is also 
your hit point maximum.
R ecord your character’s hit points on your character 
sheet. Also record the type o f Hit Die your character 
uses and the number of Hit D ice you have. After you 
rest, you can spend Hit D ice to regain hit points (see 
“Resting” in chapter 8).
P r o f i c i e n c y  B o n u s
The table that appears in your class description shows 
your proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-level 
character. Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the 
numbers you’ll be recording on your character sheet:
•
 Attack rolls using w eapons you’re proficient with
•
 Attack rolls with spells you cast
•
 Ability checks using skills you’re proficient in
•
 Ability checks using tools you’re proficient with
•
 Saving throws you’re proficient in
•
 Saving throw DCs for spells you cast (explained in 
each spellcasting class)
Your class determines your w eapon proficiencies, 
your saving throw proficiencies, and som e of your skill 
and tool proficiencies. (Skills are described in chapter 7, 
tools in chapter 5.) Your background gives you additional 
skill and tool proficiencies, and som e races give 
you m ore proficiencies. Be sure to note all o f these 
proficiencies, as well as your proficiency bonus, on your 
character sheet.
Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die 
roll or other num ber m ore than once. Occasionally, your 
proficiency bonus might be modified (doubled or halved, 
for example) before you apply it. If a circum stance 
suggests that your proficiency bonus applies m ore than 
once to the sam e roll or that it should be multiplied 
m ore than once, you nevertheless add it only once, 
multiply it only once, and halve it only once.
B u i l d i n g  B r u e n o r , St e p  2
Bob im agines Bruenor charging into battle with an axe, 
one horn on his helmet broken off. He makes Bruenor a 
fighter and notes the fighter’s proficiencies and 1st-level 
class features on his character sheet.
As a 1st-level fighter, Bruenor has 1 Hit Die—a d 10— 
and starts with hit points equal to 10 + his Constitution 
modifier. Bob notes this, and will record the final 
number after he determines Bruenor’s Constitution 
score (see step 3). Bob also notes the proficiency bonus 
for a 1st-level character, which is +2.
3 . D e t e r m i n e  A b i l i t y  S c o r e s
Much of what your character does in the game depends 
on his or her six abilities: Strength, Dexterity, 
Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.
Each ability has a score, which is a num ber you record 
on your character sheet.
The six abilities and their use in the game are 
described in chapter 7. The Ability S core Sum m ary
table provides a quick reference for what qualities 
are m easured by each ability, what races increases 
which abilities, and what classes consider each ability 
particularly important.
You generate your character's six ability scores 
randomly. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of 
the highest three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do 
this five m ore times, so that you have six numbers. If 
you want to save time or don’t like the idea of randomly 
determining ability scores, you can use the following 
scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.
Now take your six num bers and write each number 
beside one o f your character’s six abilities to assign 
scores to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, 
W isdom , and Charisma. Afterward, make any changes 
to your ability scores as a result of your race choice.
After assigning your ability scores, determine 
your ability modifiers using the Ability Scores and 
M odifiers table. To determine an ability modifier without 
consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score 
and then divide the result by 2 (round down). Write the 
modifier next to each of your scores.
B u i l d i n g  B r u e n o r , St e p  3
Bob decides to use the standard set of scores (15, 14,
13, 12, 10, 8) for Bruenor’s abilities. Since he’s a fighter, 
he puts his highest score, 15, in Strength. His next- 
highest, 14, goes in Constitution. Bruenor might be a 
brash fighter, but Bob decides he wants the dwarf to 
be older, wiser, and a good leader, so he puts decent 
scores in W isdom  and Charisma. After applying his 
racial benefits (increasing Bruenor’s Constitution by
2 and his Strength by 2), Bruenor’s ability scores and 
modifiers look like this: Strength 17 (+3), Dexterity 10 
(+0), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 8 (-1), W isdom  13 
(+1), Charisma 12 (+1).
Bob fills in Bruenor's final hit points: 10 + his 
Constitution m odifier of +3, for a total of 13 hit points.
V a r i a n t : C u s t o m i z i n g  A b i l i t y  S c o r e s
At your Dungeon Master’s option, you can use this 
variant for determining your ability scores. The method 
described here allows you to build a character with a set 
of ability scores you choose individually.
You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. 
The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score 
Point Cost table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 
points. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score 
you can end up with, before applying racial increases. 
You can’t have a score lower than 8.
This method of determining ability scores enables 
you to create a set o f three high numbers and three low 
ones (15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set o f numbers that are above

4 . D e s c r i b e  Y o u r  C h a r a c t e r
Once you know the basic game aspects of your 
character, it’s time to flesh him or her out as a person. 
Your character needs a name. Spend a few minutes 
thinking about what he or she looks like and how  he or 
she behaves in general terms.
Using the information in chapter 4, you can flesh out 
your character’s physical appearance and personality 
traits. Choose your character’s alignment (the moral 
com pass that guides his or her decisions) and ideals. 
Chapter 4 also helps you identify the things your 
character holds m ost dear, called bonds, and the flaws 
that could one day undermine him or her.
Your character’s background describes where he or 
she cam e from, his or her original occupation, and the 
character’s place in the D&D world. Your DM might 
offer additional backgrounds beyond the ones included

in chapter 4, and might be willing to w ork with you to 
craft a background that’s a m ore precise fit for your 
character concept.
A background gives your character a background 
feature (a general benefit) and proficiency in two skills, 
and it might also give you additional languages or 
proficiency with certain kinds of tools. R ecord this 
information, along with the personality information 
you develop, on your character sheet.
Y o u r  C h a r a c t e r ’s A b i l i t i e s
Take your character’s ability scores and race into 
account as you flesh out his or her appearance 
and personality. A very strong character with low 
Intelligence might think and behave very differently 
from a very smart character with low Strength.
For example, high Strength usually corresponds 
with a burly or athletic body, while a character with 
low  Strength might be scrawny or plump.
A character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and 
slim, while a character with low  Dexterity might be 
either gangly and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered.
A character with high Constitution usually looks 
healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy. A 
character with low  Constitution might be sickly or frail.
A  character with high Intelligence might be highly 
inquisitive and studious, while a character with low 
Intelligence might speak simply or easily forget details.
A  character with high W isdom  has good judgment, 
empathy, and a general awareness of what’s going on.
A character with low W isdom  might be absent-minded, 
foolhardy, or oblivious.
A character with high Charisma exudes confidence, 
which is usually mixed with a graceful or intimidating 
presence. A character with a low Charisma might com e 
across as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid.
B u i l d i n g  B r u e n o r , St e p  4
B ob fills in som e of Bruenor’s basic details: his name, 
his sex (male), his height and weight, and his alignment 
(lawful good). His high Strength and Constitution 
suggest a healthy, athletic body, and his low Intelligence 
suggests a degree of forgetfulness.
Bob decides that Bruenor com es from a noble line, 
but his clan was expelled from its homeland when 
Bruenor was very young. He grew up working as a smith 
in the remote villages of Icewind Dale. But Bruenor 
has a heroic destiny—to reclaim his homeland—so 
Bob chooses the folk hero background for his dwarf.
He notes the proficiencies and special feature this 
background gives him.
Bob has a pretty clear picture of Bruenor’s personality 
in mind, so he skips the personality traits suggested in 
the folk hero background, noting instead that Bruenor is 
a caring, sensitive dwarf who genuinely loves his friends 
and allies, but he hides this soft heart behind a gruff, 
snarling demeanor. He chooses the ideal of fairness 
from  the list in his background, noting that Bruenor 
believes that no one is above the law.
Given his history, Bruenor’s bond is obvious: he 
aspires to som eday reclaim Mithral Hall, his homeland, 
from the shadow dragon that drove the dwarves out.
His flaw is tied to his caring, sensitive nature—he has a 
soft spot for orphans and wayward souls, leading him to 
show  m ercy even when it might not be warranted.
5 . C h o o s e  E q u i p m e n t  
Your class and background determine your character's 
starting equipment, including weapons, armor, and 
other adventuring gear. R ecord this equipment on your 
character sheet. All such items are detailed in chapter 5.
Instead of taking the gear given to you by your class 
and background, you can purchase your starting 
equipment. You have a num ber of gold pieces (gp) 
to spend based on your class, as shown in chapter 5. 
Extensive lists of equipment, with prices, also appear in 
that chapter. If you wish, you can also have one trinket 
at no cost (see the trinket table at the end o f chapter 5).
Your Strength score limits the amount o f gear you can 
carry. Try not to purchase equipment with a total weight 
(in pounds) exceeding your Strength score times 15. 
Chapter 7 has m ore information on carrying capacity.
A r m o r  C l a s s
Your Armor Class (AC) represents how well your 
character avoids being wounded in battle. Things that 
contribute to your AC include the armor you wear, the 
shield you carry, and your Dexterity modifier. Not all 
characters w ear armor or carry shields, however.
Without armor or a shield, your character’s AC equals 
10 + his or her Dexterity modifier. If your character 
wears armor, carries a shield, or both, calculate your 
AC using the rules in chapter 5. R ecord your AC on 
your character sheet.
Your character needs to be proficient with armor and 
shields to w ear and use them effectively, and your armor 
and shield proficiencies are determined by your class. 
There are drawbacks to wearing armor or carrying a 
shield if you lack the required proficiency, as explained 
in chapter 5.
Som e spells and class features give you a different 
way to calculate your AC. If you have multiple features 
that give you different ways to calculate your AC, you 
choose which one to use.
W e a p o n s
For each weapon your character wields, calculate the 
modifier you use when you attack with the w eapon and 
the damage you deal when you hit.
W hen you make an attack with a weapon, you roll 
a d20 and add your proficiency bonus (but only if you 
are proficient with the weapon) and the appropriate 
ability modifier.
•
 For attacks with melee weapons, use your Strength 
m odifier for attack and damage rolls. A  weapon that 
has the finesse property, such as a rapier, can use your 
Dexterity modifier instead.
•
 For attacks with ranged weapons, use your Dexterity 
modifier for attack and damage rolls. A w eapon that 
has the thrown property, such as a handaxe, can use 
your Strength modifier instead.
B u i l d i n g  B r u e n o r , St e p  5
Bob writes down the starting equipment from  the 
fighter class and the folk hero background. His starting 
equipment includes chain mail and a shield, which 
com bine to give Bruenor an Arm or Class of 18.
For Bruenor’s w eapons, Bob chooses a battleaxe 
and two handaxes. His battleaxe is a melee weapon, 
so Bruenor uses his Strength modifier for his attacks 
and damage. His attack bonus is his Strength modifier 
(+3) plus his proficiency bonus (+2), for a total of +5.
The battleaxe deals 1d8 slashing damage, and Bruenor 
adds his Strength modifier to the damage when he 
hits, for a total of 1d8 + 3 slashing damage. W hen 
throwing a handaxe, Bruenor has the same attack bonus 
(handaxes, as thrown weapons, use Strength for attacks 
and damage), and the weapon deals 1d6 + 3 slashing 
damage when it hits.
6. C
o m e  T o g e t h e r
Most D & D  characters don’t work alone. Each character 
plays a role within a party, a group of adventurers 
working together for a com m on purpose. Teamwork 
and cooperation greatly improve your party’s chances 
to survive the many perils in the worlds o f D u n g e o n s  
&  D r a g o n s . Talk to your fellow players and your DM 
to decide whether your characters know one another, 
how they met, and what sorts of quests the group 
might undertake.
B e y o n d  1st L e v e l
As your character goes on adventures and overcom es 
challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by 
experience points. A character w ho reaches a specified 
experience point total advances in capability. This 
advancement is called gaining a level.
W hen your character gains a level, his or her class 
often grants additional features, as detailed in the 
class description. Som e of these features allow you 
to increase your ability scores, either increasing two 
scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You can’t 
increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every 
character’s proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.
Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit 
Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier 
to the roll, and add the total to your hit point maximum. 
Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your 
class entry, which is the average result of the die roll 
(rounded up).
W hen your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your 
hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have 
attained. For example, when Bruenor reaches 8th level 
as a fighter, he increases his Constitution score from 17 
to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 
to +4. His hit point maximum then increases by 8.
The Character Advancement table sum m arizes the 
X P  you need to advance in levels from  level 1
 through 
level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a character of that 
level. Consult the information in your character’s class 
description to see what other improvements you gain 
at each level.
T i e r s  o f  P l a y  
The shading in the Character Advancement table shows 
the four tiers of play. The tiers don’t have any rules 
associated with them; they are a general description of how 
the play experience changes as characters gain levels.
In the first tier (levels 1-4), characters are effectively 
apprentice adventurers. They are learning the features 
that define them as m em bers of particular classes, 
including the major choices that flavor their class 
features as they advance (such as a wizard’s Arcane 
Tradition or a fighter’s Martial Archetype). The threats 
they face are relatively minor, usually posing a danger to 
local farmsteads or villages.
In the second tier (levels 5-10), characters com e into 
their own. Many spellcasters gain access to 3rd-level 
spells at the start of this tier, crossing a new threshold of 
magical power with spells such as fireball and lightning 
bolt. At this tier, many weapon-using classes gain the 
ability to make multiple attacks in one round. These 
characters have becom e important, facing dangers that 
threaten cities and kingdoms.
In the third tier (levels 11-16), characters have 
reached a level of power that sets them high above 
the ordinary populace and makes them special even 
am ong adventurers. At 11th level, many spellcasters 
gain access to 6th-level spells, som e of which create 
effects previously im possible for player characters to 
achieve. Other characters gain features that allow them 
to make m ore attacks or do m ore impressive things with 
those attacks. These mighty adventurers often confront 
threats to whole regions and continents.
At the fourth tier (levels 17-20), characters achieve 
the pinnacle of their class features, becom ing heroic (or 
villainous) archetypes in their own right. The fate of the 
world or even the fundamental order of the multiverse 
might hang in the balance during their adventures.

C h a p t e r  2: R a c e s

VISIT TO ONE OF THE GREAT CITIES IN THE
worlds of D u n g e o n s  & D r a g o n s — 
Waterdeep, the Free City of Greyhawk, or 
even uncanny Sigil, the City of D oors— 
overwhelms the senses. Voices chatter in 
countless different languages. The smells 
of cooking in dozens o f different cuisines 
mingle with the odors of crow ded streets and poor 
sanitation. Buildings in myriad architectural styles 
display the diverse origins of their inhabitants.
And the people them selves—people of varying size, 
shape, and color, dressed in a dazzling spectrum  
of styles and hues—represent many different races, 
from diminutive halflings and stout dwarves to 
majestically beautiful elves, mingling am ong a variety 
of human ethnicities.
Scattered am ong the m em bers of these m ore com m on 
races are the true exotics: a hulking dragonborn here, 
pushing his way through the crowd, and a sly tiefling 
there, lurking in the shadows with m ischief in her eyes. 
A group o f gnom es laughs as one of them activates a 
clever w ooden toy that m oves of its own accord. Half- 
elves and half-orcs live and work alongside humans, 
without fully belonging to the races of either of their 
parents. And there, well out of the sunlight, is a lone 
drow—a fugitive from the subterranean expanse of 
the Underdark, trying to make his way in a world 
that fears his kind.
C h o o s i n g  a  Race
Humans are the m ost com m on people in the w orlds of 
D&D, but they live and work alongside dwarves, elves, 
halflings, and countless other fantastic species. Your 
character belongs to one of these peoples.
Not every intelligent race of the multiverse is 
appropriate for a player-controlled adventurer. Dwarves, 
elves, halflings, and humans are the m ost com m on 
races to produce the sort of adventurers w ho make up 
typical parties. Dragonborn, gnom es, half-elves, half- 
orcs, and tieflings are less com m on as adventurers. 
Drow, a subrace of elves, are also uncom m on.
Your choice o f race affects many different aspects of 
your character. It establishes fundamental qualities that 
exist throughout your character’s adventuring career. 
W hen making this decision, keep in mind the kind of 
character you want to play. For example, a halfling could 
be a good choice for a sneaky rogue, a dwarf makes a 
tough warrior, and an elf can be a master of arcane magic.
Your character race not only affects your ability scores 
and traits but also provides the cues for building your 
character’s story. Each race’s description in this chapter 
includes information to help you roleplay a character of 
that race, including personality, physical appearance, 
features o f society, and racial alignment tendencies. 
These details are suggestions to help you think about 
your character; adventurers can deviate widely from the 
norm for their race. It’s worthwhile to consider why your 
character is different, as a helpful way to think about 
your character’s background and personality.
R a c i a l  T r
a
i t
s
The description of each race includes racial traits that 
are com m on to m em bers of that race. The following 
entries appear am ong the traits of most races.
A b i l i t y  S c o r e  I n c r e a s e
Every race increases one or m ore of a character’s
ability scores.
A g e
The age entry notes the age when a m em ber o f the race 
is considered an adult, as well as the race’s expected 
lifespan. This information can help you decide how 
old your character is at the start of the game. You 
can choose any age for your character, which could 
provide an explanation for som e of your ability scores. 
For example, if you play a young or very old character, 
your age could explain a particularly low  Strength or 
Constitution score, while advanced age could account 
for a high Intelligence or W isdom .
A l i g n m e n t
Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, 
described in this entry. These are not binding for player 
characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, 
for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help 
you better define your character.
S iz e
Characters of most races are Medium, a size category 
including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. 
M embers of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet 
tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect 
them differently. The m ost important o f these rules 
is that Sm all characters have trouble w ielding heavy 
weapons, as explained in chapter 6.
S p e e d
Your speed determines how far you can move when 
traveling (chapter 8) and fighting (chapter 9).
L a n g u a g e s
By virtue of your race, your character can speak, read, 
and write certain languages. Chapter 4 lists the most 
com m on languages of the D&D multiverse.
Su b r a c e s
Som e races have subraces. M em bers of a subrace 
have the traits of the parent race in addition to the 
traits specified for their subrace. Relationships am ong 
subraces vary significantly from race to race and 
world to world. In the Dragonlance cam paign setting, 
for example, mountain dwarves and hill dwarves live 
together as different clans of the sam e people, but in 
the Forgotten Realms, they live far apart in separate 
kingdom s and call themselves shield dwarves and 
gold dwarves, respectively.
S h o r t  a n d
S t o u t
Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as 
skilled warriors, miners, and workers 
of stone and metal. Though they stand 
well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so 
broad and compact that they can weigh 
as much as a human standing nearly two 
feet taller. Their courage and endurance 
are also easily a match for any of 
the larger folk.
Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler 
hue tinged with red, but the most com m on shades are 
light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. 
Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually 
black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have 
red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and 
groom  them carefully.
L o n g  M e m o r y , L o n g  G r u d g e s
Dwarves can live to be m ore than 400 years old, so the 
oldest living dwarves often rem em ber a very different 
world. For example, som e of the oldest dwarves living 
in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms) 
can recall the day, m ore than three centuries ago, when 
orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile 
that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a 
perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as 
humans and halflings lack.
Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains 
they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic 
endurance and little change. They respect the traditions 
of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the 
founding o f their m ost ancient strongholds in the youth 
of the world, and don't abandon those traditions lightly. 
Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the 
dwarves, w ho uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious 
labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.
Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to 
their w ord and decisive in action, som etim es to the point 
of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense
Kingdom s rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the 
roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hamm ers 
in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to 
clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and 
orc s—these com m on threads unite all dwarves.
“Y e r l a t e , e l f !” c a m e  t h e  r o u g h  e d g e  o f  a  f a m il ia r  
voice. Bruenor Battlehammer walked up the back of his 
dead 
foe, disregarding the 
fact that the heavy monster lay 
on top of his elven 
friend. In spite of the added discomfort, 
the dwarf’s long, pointed, often-broken nose and gray- 
streaked though still-fiery red beard came as a welcome 
sight to Drizzt. “Knew I’d f
ind 
ye in trouble if 
I came out 
an' looked 
for 
ye!"
—R. A . Salvatore, The Crystal Shard
D w a r f
o f 
justice, and they are slow  to forget w rongs they have 
suffered. A w rong done to one dwarf is a w rong done to 
the dwarf’s entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf’s 
hunt for vengeance can becom e a full-blown clan feud.
C l a n s  a n d  K i n g d o m s  
Dwarven kingdom s stretch deep beneath the mountains 
where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals 
and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and 
artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry, and in som e 
dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth 
they can’t find in their mountains, they gain through 
trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and 
halflings frequently handle trade in dwarven goods 
along water routes. Trustworthy m em bers of other races 
are w elcom e in dwarf settlements, though som e areas 
are off limits even to them.
The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and 
dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves 
who live far from  their own kingdom s cherish their clan 
identities and affiliations, recognize related dwarves, 
and invoke their ancestors’ names in oaths and curses. 
To be clanless is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf.
Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, 
especially weaponsm iths, armorers, and jewelers. Som e 
becom e m ercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after 
for their courage and loyalty.
G o d s , G o l d , a n d  C l a n
Dwarves w ho take up the adventuring life might be 
motivated by a desire for treasure—for its own sake, for 
a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to 
help others. Other dwarves are driven by the com m and 
or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a 
desire to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and 
ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might 
seek to restore a clan’s lost honor, avenge an ancient 
wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place within the 
clan after having been exiled. Or a dwarf might search 
for the axe w ielded by a mighty ancestor, lost on the field 
of battle centuries ago.
S l o w  t o  T r u s t
Dwarves get along passably well with most other races. “The 
difference between an acquaintance and a friend is about a 
hundred years,” is a dwarf saying that might be hyperbole, 
but certainly points to how difficult it can be for a member of 
a short-lived race like humans to earn a dwarf’s trust.
Elves. “ It’s not wise to depend on the elves. No telling what 
an elf will do next; when the hammer meets the orc’s head, 
they’re as apt to start singing as to pull out a sword. They’re 
flighty and frivolous. Two things to be said for them, though: 
They don’t have many smiths, but the ones they have do very 
fine work. And when orcs or goblins come streaming down 
out of the mountains, an elf’s good to have at your back. Not 
as good as a dwarf, maybe, but no doubt they hate the orcs 
as much as we do.”
Halflings. “Sure, they’re pleasant folk. But show me a 
halfling hero. An empire, a triumphant army. Even a treasure 
for the ages made by halfling hands. Nothing. How can you 
take them seriously?”
Humans. “You take the time to get to know a human, and 
by then the human’s on her deathbed. If 
you’re lucky, she’s 
got kin— a daughter or granddaughter, maybe— who’s got 
hands and heart as good as hers. That’s when you can make 
a human friend. And watch them go! They set their hearts on 
something, they’ll get it, whether it’s a dragon’s hoard or an 
empire’s throne. You have to admire that kind of dedication, 
even if it gets them in trouble more often than not.”
D w a r f  N a m e s  
A dwarf’s name is granted by a clan elder, in accordance 
with tradition. Every proper dwarven name has been 
used and reused down through the generations. A 
dw arf’s name belongs to the clan, not to the individual.
A dwarf w ho m isuses or brings shame to a clan name 
is stripped of the name and forbidden by law to use any 
dwarven name in its place.

D w a r f  T r a i t s
Your dwarf character has an assortm ent of inborn 
abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature.
Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score 
increases by 2.
Age. Dwarves mature at the sam e rate as humans, but 
they’re considered young until they reach the age of 50. 
On average, they live about 350 years.
Alignment. Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly 
in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend 
toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and 
a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of 
a just order.
Size. Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and 
average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.
Speed. Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your 
speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.
Darkvision. Accustom ed to life underground, you 
have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You 
can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were 
bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You 
can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
Dwarven Resilience. You have advantage on saving 
throws against poison, and you have resistance against 
poison damage (explained in chapter 9).
Dwarven Combat Training. You have proficiency 
with the battleaxe, handaxe, throwing hammer, 
and warhammer.
Tool Proficiency. You gain proficiency with the 
artisan’s tools of your choice: smith’s tools, brewer’s 
supplies, or m ason’s tools.
Stonecunning. W henever you make an Intelligence 
(History) check related to the origin of stonework, you 
are considered proficient in the History skill and add 
double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of 
your normal proficiency bonus.
Languages. You can speak, read, and write Com m on 
and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and 
guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into 
whatever other language a dwarf might speak.
Subrace. Two main subraces o f dwarves populate the 
worlds of D&D: hill dwarves and mountain dwarves. 
Choose one of these subraces.
H i l l  D w a r f
As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, 
and remarkable resilience. The gold dwarves of Faerun 
in their mighty southern kingdom are hill dwarves, as 
are the exiled Neidar and the debased Klar of Krynn in 
the Dragonlance setting.
Ability Score Increase. Your W isdom  score 
increases by 1.
Dwarven Toughness. Your hit point maximum 
increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you 
gain a level.
M o u n t a i n  D w a r f
As a mountain dwarf, you're strong and hardy, 
accustom ed to a difficult life in rugged terrain. You’re 
probably on the tall side (for a dwarf), and tend toward 
lighter coloration. The shield dwarves of northern 
Faerun, as well as the ruling Hylar clan and the noble 
Daewar clan of Dragonlance, are mountain dwarves.
Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score 
increases by 2.
Dwarven Armor Training. You have proficiency with 
light and medium armor.
D u e r g a r
In cities deep in the Underdark live the duergar, or gray 
dwarves. These vicious, stealthy slave traders raid the surface 
world for captives, then sell their prey to the other races of 
the Underdark. They have innate magical abilities to become 
invisible and to temporarily grow to giant size.
E lf
“I HAVE NEVER IMAGINED SUCH BEAUTY EXISTED,”
Goldmoon said softly. The day’s march had been difficult, 
but the reward at the end was beyond their dreams.
The companions stood on a high cliff over the 
fabled 
city of Qualinost.
Four slender spires rose 
from the city’s corners like glisten- 
ing 
spindles, their brilliant white stone marbled with shining 
silver. Graceful arches, swooping 
from spire to spire, soared 
through the air. Crafted by ancient dwarven metalsmiths, 
they were strong enough to hold the weight of an army, yet 
they appeared so delicate that a bird lighting on them might 
overthrow the balance. These glistening arches were the 
city’s only boundaries; there was no wall around Qualinost. 
The elven city opened its arms lovingly to the wilderness.
—M argaret W eis & Tracy H ickm an, 
Dragons of 
Autumn Twilight
Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living 
in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in 
places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests 
or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where 
soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances 
waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art 
and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things 
of the world.
S l e n d e r  a n d  G r a c e f u l
With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves 
appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and mem bers 
of many other races. They are slightly shorter than 
humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet 
tall to just over 6 feet. They are m ore slender than 
humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and
females are about the same height, and males are only 
marginally heavier than females.
Elves’ coloration encom passes the normal human 
range and also includes skin in shades of copper, 
bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, 
and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no 
facial and little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in 
bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry.
A  T i m e l e s s  P e r s p e c t i v e
Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad 
perspective on events that might trouble the shorter- 
lived races m ore deeply. They are m ore often amused 
than excited, and m ore likely to be curious than 
greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty 
happenstance. W hen pursuing a goal, however, whether
adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, 
elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow  to 
make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget 
them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to 
serious insults with vengeance.
Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible 
in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and 
com prom ise to resolve differences before they escalate 
to violence. They have been known to retreat from 
intrusions into their w oodland homes, confident 
that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when 
the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, 
demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy.
H i d d e n  W o o d l a n d  R e a l m s
Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden am ong 
the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow 
vegetables, and their skill and magic allow them to 
support themselves without the need for clearing and 
plowing land. They are talented artisans, crafting finely 
worked clothes and art objects. Their contact with 
outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a 
good living by trading crafted items for metals (which 
they have no interest in mining).
Elves encountered outside their own lands are 
com m only traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human 
nobles com pete for the services of elf instructors to 
teach swordplay or magic to their children.
E x p l o r a t i o n  a n d  A d v e n t u r e
Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since 
they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of 
exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of 
human society, which is regimented from day to day but 
constantly changing over decades, so they find careers 
that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves 
also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining 
greater magical power, and adventuring allows them
to do so. Som e might join with rebels fighting against 
oppression, and others might becom e champions of 
moral causes.
E l f  N a m e s  
Elves are considered children until they declare 
themselves adults, som e time after the hundredth 
birthday, and before this period they are called 
by child names.
On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name, 
although those w ho knew him or her as a youngster 
might continue to use the child name. Each elf’s adult 
name is a unique creation, though it might reflect 
the names o f respected individuals or other family 
mem bers. Little distinction exists between male 
names and female names; the groupings here reflect 
only general tendencies. In addition, every elf bears a 
family name, typically a com bination of other Elvish 
words. Som e elves traveling am ong humans translate 
their family names into Com m on, but others retain the 
Elvish version.
Child Names: Ara, Bryn, Del, Eryn, Faen, Innil.

Rolen, Soveliss, Thamior, Tharivol, Theren, Varis
H a u g h t y  b u t  G r a c i o u s
Although they can be haughty, elves are generally gracious 
even to those who fall short of their high expectations— 
which is most non-elves. Still, they can find good in just 
about anyone.
Dwarves. “ Dwarves are dull, clumsy oafs. But what they 
lack in humor, sophistication, and manners, they make up in 
valor. And I
 must admit, their best smiths produce art that 
approaches elven quality.”
Halflings. “ Halflings are people of simple pleasures, and 
that is not a quality to scorn. They’re good folk, they care 
for each other and tend their gardens, and they have proven 
themselves tougher than they seem when the need arises."
Humans. “All that haste, their ambition and drive to 
accomplish something before their brief lives pass away— 
human endeavors seem so futile sometimes. But then 
you look at what they have accomplished, and you have to 
appreciate their achievements. If only they could slow down 
and learn some refinement.”
Female Adult Names: Adrie, Althaea, Anastrianna, 
Andraste, Antinua, Bethrynna, Birel, Caelynn, 
Drusilia, Enna, Felosial, Ielenia, Jelenneth, Keyleth, 
Leshanna, Lia, Meriele, Mialee, Naivara, Quelenna,

(Gemblossom), Liadon (Silverfrond), Meliamne 
(Oakenheel), Nai'lo (Nightbreeze), Siannodel 
(M oonbrook), Xiloscient (Goldpetal)
E l f  T r a i t s
Your elf character has a variety o f natural abilities, the 
result o f thousands o f years of elven refinement.
Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score 
increases by 2.
Age. Although elves reach physical maturity at about 
the sam e age as humans, the elven understanding of 
adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encom pass 
worldly experience. An elf typically claim s adulthood 
and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live 
to be 750 years old.
Alignment. Elves love freedom, variety, and self- 
expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler 
aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' 
freedom  as well as their own, and they are more 
often good than not. The drow are an exception; their 
exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and 
dangerous. D row are m ore often evil than not.
Size. Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and 
have slender builds. Your size is Medium.
Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. 
Darkvision. Accustom ed to twilit forests and the night 
sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. 
You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it 
were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. 
You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
Keen Senses. You have proficiency in the 
Perception skill.
Fey 
Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws 
against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.
Trance. Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they 
meditate deeply, remaining sem iconscious, for 4 
hours a day. (The Com m on word for such meditation 
is “trance.”) W hile meditating, you can dream after a 
fashion; such dream s are actually mental exercises that 
have becom e reflexive through years of practice. After 
resting in this way, you gain the sam e benefit that a 
human does from 8 hours of sleep.
Languages. You can speak, read, and write Com m on 
and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and 
intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, 
and their songs and poem s are famous am ong other 
races. Many bards learn their language so they can add 
Elvish ballads to their repertoires.
Subrace. Ancient divides am ong the elven people 
resulted in three main subraces: high elves, w ood elves, 
and dark elves, who are com m only called drow. Choose 
one of these subraces. In som e worlds, these subraces 
are divided still further (such as the sun elves and m oon 
elves of the Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can 
choose a narrower subrace.
H i g h  E l f
As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of 
at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds 
of D&D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type 
(which includes the gray elves and valley elves of 
Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the 
sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and 
reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to 
non-elves and even other elves. The other type 
(including the high elves of Greyhawk. the 
Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the m oon elves 
of the Forgotten Realms) are m ore com m on 
and m ore friendly, and often encountered 
am ong humans and other races.
The sun elves of Faerun (also called gold 
elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and 
hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their 
eyes are golden, silver, or black. M oon elves (also 
called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, 
with alabaster skin som etim es tinged with blue.
They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, 
but various shades of blond, brown, and red are 
not uncom m on. Their eyes are blue or green and 
flecked with gold.
Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score

Elf 
Weapon Training. You have proficiency with 
the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.
Cantrip. You know one cantrip of your choice from 
the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting 
ability for it.
Extra Language. You can speak, read, and write one 
extra language of your choice.
W o o d  E l f
As a w ood elf, you have keen senses and intuition, and 
your fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through 
your native forests. This category includes the wild 
elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of 
Dragonlance, as well as the races called w ood elves in 
Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. In Faerun, w ood 
elves (also called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves) 
are reclusive and distrusting o f non-elves.
W ood elves’ skin tends to be copperish in hue, 
som etim es with traces of green. Their hair tends toward 
browns and blacks, but it is occasionally blond or 
copper-colored. Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel.
Ability Score Increase. Your W isdom  score

you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, 
falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.
T h e  D a r k n e s s  o f  t h e  D r o w
Were it not for one renowned exception, the race of drow 
would be universally reviled. To most, they are a race of 
demon-worshiping marauders dwelling in the subterranean 
depths of the Underdark, emerging only on the blackest 
nights to pillage and slaughter the surface dwellers they 
despise. Their society is depraved and preoccupied with the 
favor of Lolth, their spider-goddess, who sanctions murder 
and the extermination of entire families as noble houses 
vie for position.
Yet one drow, at least, broke the mold. In
 the world of the 
Forgotten Realms, Drizzt Do'Urden, ranger of the North, has 
proven his quality as a good-hearted defender of the weak 
and innocent. Rejecting his heritage and adrift in a world that 
looks upon him with terror and loathing, Drizzt is a model 
for those few drow who follow in his footsteps, trying to find 
a life apart from the evil society of their Underdark homes.
Drow grow up believing that surface-dwelling races are 
inferior, worthless except as slaves. Drow who develop a 
conscience or find it necessary to cooperate with members of 
other races find it hard to overcome that prejudice, especially 
when they are so often on the receiving end of hatred.
D a r k  E l f  ( D r o w )
D escended from an earlier subrace of dark-skinned 
elves, the drow were banished from the surface world 
for following the goddess Lolth down the path to 
evil and corruption. Now they have built their own 
civilization in the depths of the Underdark, patterned 
after the Way of Lolth. Also called dark elves, the drow 
have black skin that resem bles polished obsidian and 
stark white or pale yellow hair. They com m only have 
very pale eyes (so pale as to be mistaken for white) in 
shades of lilac, silver, pink, red, and blue. They tend to 
be smaller and thinner than m ost elves.
Drow adventurers are rare, and the race does not exist 
in all worlds. Check with your Dungeon Master to see 
if you can play a drow character.
Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score

Superior Darkvision. Your darkvision has a

Sunlight Sensitivity. You have disadvantage on attack 
rolls and on W isdom  (Perception) checks that rely on 
sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever 
you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.
Drow Magic. You know the dancing lights cantrip. 
W hen you reach 3rd level, you can cast the faerie fire 
spell once per day. W hen you reach 5th level, you can 
also cast the darkness spell once per day. Charisma is 
your spellcasting ability for these spells.
Drow Weapon Training. You have proficiency with 
rapiers, shortswords, and hand crossbow s.

lives: a place to  settle in peace and quiet, far from 
marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire 
and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation. 
Though som e halflings live out their days in remote 
agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands 
that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the 
wide horizon to discover the w onders of new lands and 
peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, 
hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon 
jostling along an dirt road or a raft floating downriver.
S m a l l  a n d  P r

l
The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger 
creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding 
offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively 
harm less and so have managed to survive for centuries 
in the shadow of empires and on the edges o f wars and 
political strife. They are inclined to be stout, weighing 
between 40 and 45 pounds.
Halflings’ skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy 
cast, and their hair is usually brown or sandy brown 
and wavy. They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men 
often sport long sideburns, but beards are rare among 
them and mustaches even m ore so. They like to wear 
simple, comfortable, and practical clothes, favoring 
bright colors.
Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing. 
They’re concerned with basic needs and simple 
pleasures and have little use for ostentation. Even the 
wealthiest of halflings keep their treasures locked in a 
cellar rather than on display for all to see. They have 
a knack for finding the most straightforward solution 
to a problem, and have little patience for dithering.
K i n d  a n d  C u r i o u s
Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. They 
cherish the bonds of family and friendship as well 
as the com forts of hearth and home, harboring few 
dream s of gold or glory. Even adventurers among 
them usually venture into the world for reasons of
A f f a b l e  a n d  P o s i t i v e
community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity. They 
love discovering new things, even simple things, such 
as an exotic food or an unfamiliar style of clothing.
Halflings are easily m oved to pity and hate to see any 
living thing suffer. They are generous, happily sharing 
what they have even in lean times.
B l e n d  i n t o  t h e  C r o w d  
Halflings are adept at fitting into a community of 
humans, dwarves, or elves, making themselves valuable 
and w elcom e. The combination of their inherent stealth 
and their unassum ing nature helps halflings to avoid 
unwanted attention.
Halflings w ork readily with others, and they are loyal 
to their friends, whether halfling or otherwise. They can 
display remarkable ferocity when their friends, families, 
or com m unities are threatened.
P a s t o r a l  P l e a s a n t r i e s
M ost halflings live in small, peaceful communities with 
large farms and well-kept groves. They rarely build 
kingdom s o f their own or even hold much land beyond 
their quiet shires. They typically don’t recognize any 
sort of halfling nobility or royalty, instead looking to 
family elders to guide them. Families preserve their 
traditional ways despite the rise and fall of empires.
Many halflings live am ong other races, where the 
halflings’ hard work and loyal outlook offer them 
abundant rewards and creature com forts. S om e halfling 
com m unities travel as a way of life, driving wagons or 
guiding boats from place to place and maintaining no 
permanent home.
Halflings try to get along with everyone else and are loath to 
make sweeping generalizations— especially negative ones.
Dwarves. “Dwarves make loyal friends, and you can count 
on them to keep their word. But would it hurt them to smile 
once in a while?”
 
Elves. "They’re so beautiful! Their faces, their music, their 
grace and all. It’s like they stepped out of a wonderful dream. 
But there’s no telling what’s going on behind their smiling 
faces— surely more than they ever let on.”
Humans. “ Humans are a lot like us, really. At least some 
of 
them are. Step out of the castles and keeps, go talk to the 
farmers and herders and you’ll find good, solid folk. Not that 
there’s anything wrong with the barons and soldiers—you 
have to admire their conviction. And by protecting their own 
lands, they protect us as well.”
E x p l o r i n g  O p p o r t u n i t i e s
Halflings usually set out on the adventurer’s path to 
defend their communities, support their friends, or 
explore a wide and wonder-filled world. For them, 
adventuring is less a career than an opportunity or 
som etim es a necessity.
H a l f l i n g  N a m e s
A halfling has a given name, a family name, and possibly 
a nickname. Family nam es are often nicknam es that 
stuck so tenaciously they have been passed down 
through the generations.
Male Names: Alton, Ander, Cade, Corrin, Eldon, Errich, 
Finnan, Garret, Lindal, Lyle, Merric, Milo, Osborn,

Languages. You can speak, read, and write Com m on 
and Halfling. The Halfling language isn’t secret, but 
halflings are loath to share it with others. They write 
very little, so they don’t have a rich body o f literature. 
Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Alm ost all 
halflings speak Com m on to converse with the people 
in w hose lands they dwell or through which they 
are traveling.
Subrace. The two main kinds of halfling, lightfoot and 
stout, are m ore like closely related families than true 
subraces. C hoose one of these subraces.
L i g h t f o o t
As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice, 
even using other people as cover. You’re inclined to be 
affable and get along well with others. In the Forgotten 
Realms, lightfoot halflings have spread the farthest and 
thus are the most com m on variety.
Lightfoots are m ore prone to wanderlust than other 
halflings, and often dwell alongside other races or take 
up a nomadic life. In the world of Greyhawk, these 
halflings are called hairfeet or tallfellows.

when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least 
one size larger than you.

Age. A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 
20 and generally lives into the middle of his or her 
second century.
Alignment. Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule, 
they are good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in 
pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are 
also very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on 
the support of their com m unity and the com fort of 
their old ways.
Size. Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh 
about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.
Speed. Your base walking speed is 25 feet.
Lucky. W hen you roll a 1 on an attack roll, ability

being frightened.
Halfling Nimbleness. You can move through the

—Elaine C unningham , Daughter of the Drow
In the reckonings o f most worlds, humans are the 
youngest of the com m on races, late to arrive on the 
world scene and short-lived in com parison to dwarves, 
elves, and dragons. Perhaps it is because of their shorter 
lives that they strive to achieve as much as they can in 
the years they are given. Or maybe they feel they have 
som ething to prove to the elder races, and that’s why 
they build their mighty empires on the foundation of 
conquest and trade. Whatever drives them, humans 
are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers 
of the worlds.
A  B r o a d  S p e c t r u m
With their penchant for migration and conquest, 
humans are m ore physically diverse than other com m on 
races. There is no typical human. An individual can 
stand from  5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh 
from 125 to 250 pounds. Human skin shades range 
from nearly black to very pale, and hair colors from 
black to blond (curly, kinky, or straight); males might 
sport facial hair that is sparse or thick. A lot of humans 
have a dash of nonhuman blood, revealing hints of elf, 
orc , or other lineages. Humans reach adulthood in their 
late teens and rarely live even a single century.
V a r i e t y  i n  A l l  T h i n g s
Humans are the m ost adaptable and ambitious people 
am ong the com m on races. They have widely varying 
tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands 
where they have settled. W hen they settle, though, 
they stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and 
great kingdom s that can persist for long centuries. An 
individual human might have a relatively short life span, 
but a human nation or culture preserves traditions 
with origins far beyond the reach of any single human’s 
memory. They live fully in the present—making them 
well suited to the adventuring life—but also plan for the 
future, striving to leave a lasting legacy. Individually and 
as a group, humans are adaptable opportunists, and 
they stay alert to changing political and social dynamics.
Ev e r y o n e ’s S e c o n d - B e s t  F r i e n d s
Just as readily as they mix with each other, humans mingle 
with members of other races. They get along with almost 
everyone, though they might not be close to many. Humans 
serve as ambassadors, diplomats, magistrates, merchants, 
and functionaries of all kinds.
Dwarves. “They’re stout folk, stalwart friends, and true to 
their word. Their greed for gold is their downfall, though.”
Elves. “It’s best not to wander into elven woods. They don't 
like intruders, and you’ll as likely be bewitched as peppered 
with arrows. Still, if an elf can get past that damned racial 
pride and actually treat you like an equal, you can learn a lot 
from them.”
Halflings. "It’s hard to beat a meal in a halfling home, as 
long as you don’t crack your head on the ceiling— good food 
and good stories in front of a nice, warm fire. If halflings had 
a shred of ambition, they might really amount to something.”
L a s t i n g  I n s t i t u t i o n s
W here a single elf or dwarf might take on the 
responsibility of guarding a special location or a 
powerful secret, humans found sacred orders and 
institutions for such purposes. W hile dwarf clans and 
halfling elders pass on the ancient traditions to each 
new generation, human temples, governments, libraries, 
and codes of law fix their traditions in the bedrock of 
history. Humans dream of immortality, but (except for 
those few who seek undeath or divine ascension to 
escape death’s clutches) they achieve it by ensuring that 
they will be rem em bered when they are gone.
Although som e humans can be xenophobic, in 
general their societies are inclusive. Human lands 
welcom e large numbers of nonhumans com pared to the 
proportion of humans w ho live in nonhuman lands.
E x e m p l a r s  o f  A m b i t i o n
Humans w ho seek adventure are the most daring and 
ambitious m em bers of a daring and ambitious race.
They seek to earn glory in the eyes of their fellows 
by am assing power, wealth, and fame. More than 
other people, humans champion causes rather than 
territories or groups.

Chondathans are slender, tawny-skinned folk with 
brown hair that ranges from almost blond to almost

but these traits are hardly universal. Humans of 
Chondathan descent dominate the central lands of 
Faerun. around the Inner Sea.
parents give their children names from other languages, 
such as Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced m ore or less 
correctly), but most parents give names that are linked 
to their region’s culture or to the naming traditions of 
their ancestors.
The material culture and physical characteristics 
of humans can change wildly from region to region.
In the Forgotten Realms, for example, the clothing, 
architecture, cuisine, music, and literature are different 
in the northwestern lands of the Silver M arches than 
in distant Turmish or Impiltur to the east—and even 
more distinctive in far-off Kara-Tur. Human physical 
characteristics, though, vary according to the ancient 
migrations of the earliest humans, so that the humans 
of the Silver M arches have every possible variation of 
coloration and features.
In the Forgotten Realms, nine human ethnic groups 
are widely recognized, though over a dozen others are 
found in m ore localized areas of Faerun. These groups, 
and the typical nam es o f their mem bers, can be used as 
inspiration no matter which world your human is in.

Dominant in the eastern and southeastern shores of 
the Inner Sea, the Mulan are generally tall, slim, and

It’s hard to make generalizations about humans, but 
your human character has these traits.
Ability Score Increase. Your ability scores each

Age. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and 
live less than a century.
Alignment. Humans tend toward no 
particular alignment. The best and the worst are 
found am ong them.
Size. Humans vary widely in height and build, from 
barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your 
position in that range, your size is Medium.
Speed. Your base w alking speed is 30 feet. 
Languages. You can speak, read, and write Com m on 
and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically 
learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, 
including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling 
their speech with w ords borrowed from other tongues: 
Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish 
military phrases, and so on.

your Dungeon Master might allow these variant traits, all of 
which replace the human’s Ability Score Increase trait.

—Erin M. Evans, The Adversary
Born of dragons, as their name proclaim s, the 
dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets 
them with fearful incom prehension. Shaped by draconic 
gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally 
hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, com bining 
the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Som e 
dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others 
form the ranks o f soldiers in great wars, and still others 
find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.
P r o u d  D r a g o n  K i n
Dragonborn look very much like dragons standing erect 
in humanoid form, though they lack wings or a tail. The 
first dragonborn had scales of vibrant hues matching 
the colors of their dragon kin, but generations of 
interbreeding have created a m ore uniform appearance. 
Their small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze 
in color, som etim es ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or 
copper-green. They are tall and strongly built, often 
standing close to 6  1
/
2 feet tall and weighing 300 pounds 
or more. Their hands and feet are strong, talonlike 
claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand.
The blood of a particular type of dragon runs 
very strong through som e dragonborn clans. These 
dragonborn often boast scales that m ore closely match 
those of their dragon ancestor—bright red, green, blue, 
or white, lustrous black, or gleam ing metallic gold, 
silver, brass, copper, or bronze.
S e l f - S u f f i c i e n t  C l a n s
To any dragonborn, the clan is m ore important than 
life itself. Dragonborn owe their devotion and respect 
to their clan above all else, even the gods. Each 
dragonborn’s conduct reflects on the honor of his or her 
clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result in 
expulsion and exile. Each dragonborn knows his or her 
station and duties within the clan, and honor demands 
maintaining the bounds of that position.
A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the 
self-sufficiency of the race as a whole. Dragonborn value 
skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, 
and they push themselves to extreme efforts before they 
give up on something. A  dragonborn holds mastery of 
a particular skill as a lifetime goal. M embers of other 
races w ho share the sam e commitment find it easy to 
earn the respect o f a dragonborn.
Though all dragonborn strive to be self-sufficient, 
they recognize that help is som etim es needed in difficult 
situations. But the best source for such help is the 
clan, and when a clan needs help, it turns to another 
dragonborn clan before seeking aid from other races— 
or even from the gods.
D r a g o n b o r n  N a m e s
Dragonborn have personal nam es given at birth, 
but they put their clan names first as a mark of 
honor. A childhood name or nicknam e is often used 
am ong clutchmates as a descriptive term or a term 
of endearment. The name might recall an event or 
center on a habit.

The dragonborn and the rest of the races in this chapter are 
uncommon. They don’t exist in every world of D&D, and 
even where they are found, they are less widespread than 
dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans.
In
 the cosmopolitan cities of 
the D&D multiverse, most 
people hardly look twice at members of even the most 
exotic races. But the small towns and villages that dot 
the countryside are different. The common folk aren’t 
accustomed to seeing members of these races, and they 
react accordingly.
Dragonborn. It’s easy to assume that a dragonborn is a
 
monster, especially if his or her scales betray a chromatic 
heritage. Unless the dragonborn starts breathing fire and 
causing destruction, though, people are likely to respond 
with caution rather than outright fear.
Gnome. Gnomes don’t look like a threat and can quickly 
disarm suspicion with good humor. The common folk are 
often curious about gnomes, likely never having seen one 
before, but they are rarely hostile or fearful.
Half-Elf. Although many people have never seen a half-elf, 
virtually everyone knows they exist. A half-elf stranger’s 
arrival is followed by gossip behind the half-elf's back and 
stolen glances across the common room, rather than any 
confrontation or open curiosity.
Half-Orc. It’s usually safe to assume that a half-orc is 
belligerent and quick to anger, so people watch themselves 
around an unfamiliar half-orc. Shopkeepers might 
surreptitiously hide valuable or fragile goods when a half-orc 
comes in, and people slowly clear out of a tavern, assuming a 
fight will break out soon.
Tiefling. Half-orcs are greeted with a practical caution, but 
tieflings are the subject of supernatural fear. The evil of their 
heritage is plainly visible in their features, and as far as most 
people are concerned, a tiefling could very well be a devil 
straight from the Nine Hells. People might make warding 
signs as a tiefling approaches, cross the street to avoid 
passing near, or bar shop doors before a tiefling can enter.

you share with other dragonborn.
Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score

Age. Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk 
hours after hatching, attain the size and development 
of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach 
adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.
Alignment. Dragonborn tend to extremes, making a 
conscious choice for one side or the other in the cosm ic 
war between good and evil (represented by Bahamut 
and Tiamat, respectively). Most dragonborn are good, 
but those w ho side with Tiamat can be terrible villains.
Size. Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, 
standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 
pounds. Your size is Medium.
Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

D r a c o n i a n s
in the Dragonlance setting, the followers of the evil goddess 
Takhisis learned a dark ritual that let them corrupt the 
eggs of metallic dragons, producing evil dragonborn called 
draconians. Five types of draconians, corresponding to the 
five types of metallic dragons, fought for Takhisis in the War 
of 
the Lance: auraks (gold), baaz (brass), bozak (bronze), 
kapak (copper), and sivak (silver). In place of 
their draconic 
breath weapons, they have unique magical abilities.
 
Draconic Ancestry. You have draconic ancestry. 
C hoose one type of dragon from the Draconic Ancestry 
table. Your breath weapon and damage resistance are 
determined by the dragon type, as shown in the table.
Breath Weapon. You can use your action to exhale 
destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines 
the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation.
W hen you use your breath weapon, each creature in 
the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw, 
the type of which is determined by your draconic 
ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + 
your Constitution m odifier + your proficiency bonus. A 
creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half 
as much damage on a successful one. The damage 
increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 
at 16th level.
After you use your breath weapon, you can’t use it 
again until you complete a short or long rest.
Damage Resistance. You have resistance to the 
damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.
Languages. You can speak, read, and write Com m on 
and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the 
oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic. 
The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and 
includes num erous hard consonants and sibilants.
G n o m e
fair hair has a tendency to stick out in every direction, 
as if expressing the gnom e’s insatiable interest in 
everything around.
A gnom e’s personality is writ large in his or her 
appearance. A male gnom e’s beard, in contrast to 
his wild hair, is kept carefully trimmed but often 
styled into curious forks or neat points. A gnom e’s 
clothing, though usually made in m odest earth tones, 
is elaborately decorated with embroidery, em bossing, 
or gleam ing jewels.
D e l i g h t e d  D e d i c a t i o n
As far as gnom es are concerned, being alive is a 
wonderful thing, and they squeeze every ounce of 
enjoyment out of their three to five centuries of life. 
Humans might w onder about getting bored over the 
course of such a long life, and elves take plenty of time 
to savor the beauties of the world in their long years, but 
gnom es seem  to worry that even with all that time, they 
can’t get in enough of the things they want to do and see.
Gnom es speak as if they can’t get the thoughts 
out of their heads fast enough. Even as they offer 
ideas and opinions on a range of subjects, they still 
manage to listen carefully to others, adding the 
appropriate exclamations of surprise and appreciation 
along the way.

itations in Oeble, that particular tenement had been built 
for humans, and smaller residents coped with the resulting 
awkwardness as best they could.
But at least the relative largeness of the apartment gave 
Burgell room to pack in all his gnome-sized gear. The 
front 
room was his workshop, and it contained a bewildering 
miscellany of tools: hammers, chisels, saws, lockpicks, 
tinted lenses, jeweler's loupes, and 
jars of 
powdered and 
shredded ingredients 
for casting spells. A 
fat gray cat, the 
mage’s 
familiar, lay curled atop a grimoire. It opened its 
eyes, gave 
Aeron a disdainful 
yellow stare, then appeared 
to go back to sleep.
—R ichard Lee Byers, The Black Bouquet
A  constant hum o f busy activity pervades the warrens 
and neighborhoods where gnom es form their close- 
knit communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: 
a crunch of grinding gears here, a m inor explosion 
there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially 
bursts of laughter. G nom es take delight in life, enjoying 
every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, 
creation, and play.
V i b r a n t  E x p r e s s i o n
A gnom e’s energy and enthusiasm for living shines 
through every inch of his or her tiny body. Gnom es 
average slightly over 3 feet tall and w eigh 40 to 45 
pounds. Their tan or brown faces are usually adorned 
with broad sm iles (beneath their prodigious noses), 
and their bright eyes shine with excitement. Their
Though gnom es love jokes o f all kinds, particularly 
puns and pranks, they’re just as dedicated to the m ore 
serious tasks they undertake. Many gnom es are skilled 
engineers, alchemists, tinkers, and inventors. They’re 
willing to make mistakes and laugh at themselves in 
the process of perfecting what they do, taking bold 
(som etim es foolhardy) risks and dream ing large.
B r i g h t  B u r r o w s
Gnom es make their hom es in hilly, w ooded lands. They 
live underground but get more fresh air than dwarves 
do, enjoying the natural, living world on the surface 
whenever they can. Their hom es are well hidden by 
both clever construction and simple illusions. W elcom e 
visitors are quickly ushered into the bright, warm 
burrows. Those w ho are not w elcom e are unlikely to 
find the burrows in the first place.
Gnom es w ho settle in human lands are com m only 
gemcutters, engineers, sages, or tinkers. Som e human 
families retain gnom e tutors, ensuring that their pupils 
enjoy a mix of serious learning and delighted enjoyment. 
A gnom e might tutor several generations of a single 
human family over the course of his or her long life.
G n o m e  N a m e s
Gnom es love names, and most have half a dozen or so.
A gnom e's mother, father, clan elder, aunts, and uncles 
each give the gnom e a name, and various nicknam es 
from just about everyone else might or might not stick 
over time. Gnom e names are typically variants on the 
names of ancestors or distant relatives, though som e 
are purely new inventions. W hen dealing with humans 
and others w ho are “stuffy” about names, a gnome 
learns to use no m ore than three names: a personal 
name, a clan name, and a nickname, choosing the one in 
each category that’s the m ost fun to say.
D e e p  G n o m e s
A third subrace of gnomes, the deep gnomes (or svirfneblin), 
live in small communities scattered in the Underdark. Unlike 
the duergar and the drow, svirfneblin are as good as their 
surface cousins. However, their humor and enthusiasm 
are dampened by their oppressive environment, and their 
inventive expertise is directed mostly toward stonework.

Curious and impulsive, gnom es might take up 
adventuring as a way to see the world or for the love 
of exploring. As lovers of gems and other fine items, 
som e gnom es take to adventuring as a quick, if 
dangerous, path to wealth. Regardless o f what spurs 
them to adventure, gnom es w ho adopt this way of life

It’s rare for a gnome to be hostile or malicious unless he 
or she has suffered a grievous injury. Gnomes know that 
most races don’t share their sense of humor, but they enjoy 
anyone's company just as they enjoy everything else they set 
out to do.
even the tricksters am ong them are m ore playful 
than vicious.
Size. Gnom es are between 3 and 4 feet tall and 
average about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.
Speed. Your base walking speed is 25 feet. 
Darkvision. Accustomed to life underground, you have 
superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can 
see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it w ere bright 
light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't 
discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
Gnome Cunning. You have advantage on all 
Intelligence, W isdom , and Charisma saving throws 
against magic.
Languages. You can speak, read, and write Com m on 
and Gnomish. The Gnomish language, which uses the 
Dwarvish script, is renowned for its technical treatises 
and its catalogs o f knowledge about the natural world.
Subrace. Two subraces of gnom es are found among 
the worlds of D&D: forest gnom es and rock gnom es. 
Choose one of these subraces.
F o r e s t  G n o m e
As a forest gnome, you have a natural knack for illusion 
and inherent quickness and stealth. In the worlds of 
D&D, forest gnom es are rare and secretive. They gather 
in hidden com m unities in sylvan forests, using illusions 
and trickery to conceal themselves from threats or 
to mask their escape should they be detected. Forest 
gnom es tend to be friendly with other good-spirited 
w oodland folk, and they regard elves and good fey as 
their most important allies. These gnom es also befriend 
small forest animals and rely on them for information 
about threats that might prowl their lands.
Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score 
increases by 1.
Natural Illusionist. You know the minor illusion 
cantrip. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.
Speak with Small Beasts. Through sounds and 
gestures, you can com m unicate simple ideas with Small 
or smaller beasts. Forest gnom es love animals and often 
keep squirrels, badgers, rabbits, moles, w oodpeckers, 
and other creatures as beloved pets.
R o c k  G n o m e
As a rock gnome, you have a natural inventiveness and 
hardiness beyond that of other gnom es. Most gnom es 
in the worlds of D&D are rock gnom es, including the 
tinker gnom es of the Dragonlance setting.
Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score 
increases by 1.
Artificer’s Lore. W henever you make an Intelligence 
(History) check related to magic items, alchemical 
objects, or technological devices, you can add twice your 
proficiency bonus, instead of any proficiency bonus you 
normally apply.
Tinker. You have proficiency with artisan’s tools 
(tinker’s tools). Using those tools, you can spend 1 
hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny 
clockw ork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases 
to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour 
repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when 
you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can 
reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up 
to three such devices active at a time.
W hen you create a device, choose one of the 
following options:
Clockwork Toy.
 This toy is a clockw ork animal, monster, 
or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or 
soldier. W hen placed on the ground, the toy m oves 
5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a 
random direction. It makes noises as appropriate 
to the creature it represents.
Fire Starter. The device produces a miniature 
flame, which you can use to light a candle, 
torch, or campfire. Using the device 
requires your action.
Music Box. W hen opened, this music box 
plays a single song at a moderate volume.
The box stops playing when it 
reaches the song’s end or 
when it is closed.
“Tanis?” said Flint hesitantly as the man neared.
“The same.” The newcomer’s bearded 
face split in a wide 
grin. He held open his arms and, before the dwarf could 
stop him, engulfed Flint in a hug that lifted him off the 
ground. The dwarf clasped his old 
friend close 
for a brief 
instant, then, remembering his dignity, squirmed and 
freed 
himself 
from the half-elf’s embrace.

W alking in two w orlds but truly belonging to neither, 
half-elves com bine what som e say are the best qualities 
o f their elf and human parents: human curiosity, 
inventiveness, and ambition tempered by the refined 
senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes o f the elves. 
S om e half-elves live am ong humans, set apart by their 
emotional and physical differences, watching friends 
and loved ones age while time barely touches them. 
Others live with the elves, growing restless as they 
reach adulthood in the timeless elven realms, while 
their peers continue to live as children. Many half-elves, 
unable to fit into either society, choose lives of solitary 
wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in 
the adventuring life.
O f  T w o  W o r l d s  
To humans, half-elves look like elves, and to elves, they 
look human. In height, they’re on par with both parents, 
though they’re neither as slender as elves nor as broad 
as humans. They range from under 5 feet to about 6 feet 
tall, and from 100 to 180 pounds, with men only slightly 
taller and heavier than women. Half-elf men do have 
facial hair, and som etim es grow beards to mask their 
elven ancestry. Half-elven coloration and features lie 
som ewhere between their human and elf parents, and 
thus show  a variety even m ore pronounced than that 
found am ong either race. They tend to have the eyes 
of their elven parents.

Half-elves have no lands o f their own, though they are 
w elcom e in human cities and som ewhat less w elcom e 
in elven forests. In large cities in regions where elves 
and humans interact often, half-elves are som etim es 
numerous enough to form small com m unities of their 
own. They enjoy the company of other half-elves, the 
only people w ho truly understand what it is to live 
between these two worlds.
In most parts of the world, though, half-elves are 
uncom m on enough that one might live for years 
without meeting another. Som e half-elves prefer to 
avoid company altogether, wandering the w ilds as 
trappers, foresters, hunters, or adventurers and visiting 
civilization only rarely. Like elves, they are driven by 
the wanderlust that com es of their longevity. Others, 
in contrast, throw themselves into the thick of society, 
putting their charisma and social skills to great use 
in diplomatic roles or as swindlers.
H a l f - E l f  N a m e s  
Half-elves use either human or elven naming 
conventions. As if to emphasize that they don’t really fit 
in to either society, half-elves raised am ong humans are 
often given elven names, and those raised am ong elves 
often take human names.

Half-orcs’ grayish pigmentation, sloping foreheads, 
jutting jaws, prominent teeth, and towering builds make 
their orcish heritage plain for all to see. Half-orcs stand 
between 6 and 7 feet tall and usually weigh between 
180 and 250 pounds.
Orcs regard battle scars as tokens of pride and 
ornamental scars as things of beauty. Other scars, 
though, mark an orc or half-orc as a former slave or 
a disgraced exile. Any half-orc who has lived among 
or near orcs has scars, whether they are marks of 
humiliation or of pride, recounting their past exploits 
and injuries. Such a half-orc living am ong humans might 
display these scars proudly or hide them in shame.
T h e  M a r k  o f  G r u u m s h
The one-eyed god Gruumsh created the orc s, and even 
those orcs who turn away from his worship can’t fully 
escape his influence. The sam e is true o f half-orcs, 
though their human blood moderates the impact of their 
orcish heritage. Som e half-orcs hear the whispers of 
Gruumsh in their dreams, calling them to unleash the 
rage that sim m ers within them. Others feel Gruumsh’s

sleeping-furs and his women and pulled a short hauberk 
of heavy steel rings over his thick, well-muscled torso. He 
usually rose before most of his warriors, since he had a 
strong 
streak of human blood in him, and he 
found the 
daylight less bothersome than most of 
his tribe did. Among 
the Bloody Skulls, a warrior was 
judged by his strength, his 
fierceness, and his wits. Human ancestry was no blemish 
against a warrior—
provided he was every bit as strong, 
enduring, and bloodthirsty as his 
full-blooded kin. Half- 
orcs who were weaker than their orc comrades didn't last 
long among the Bloody Skulls or any other orc tribe 
for 
that matter. But it was often true that a bit of human blood 
gave a warrior 
just the right mix of cunning, ambition, and 
self-discipline to go 
far indeed, as Mhurren had. He was 
master of a tribe that could muster two thousand spears, 
and the strongest chief in Thar.

exultation w hen they join in melee com bat—and either 
exult along with him or shiver with fear and loathing. 
Half-orcs are not evil by nature, but evil does lurk within 
them, whether they em brace it or rebel against it.
Beyond the rage of Gruumsh, half-orcs feel emotion 
powerfully. Rage doesn’t just quicken their pulse, it 
makes their bodies burn. An insult stings like acid, 
and sadness saps their strength. But they laugh loudly 
and heartily, and simple bodily pleasures—feasting, 
drinking, wrestling, drumming, and wild dancing—fill 
their hearts with joy. They tend to be short-tempered 
and som etim es sullen, m ore inclined to action than 
contemplation and to fighting than arguing. The most 
accom plished half-orcs are those with enough self- 
control to get by in a civilized land.
T r i b e s  a n d  S l u m s
Half-orcs most often live am ong orc s. Of the other races, 
humans are most likely to accept half-orcs, and half- 
orcs almost always live in human lands when not living 
am ong orc tribes. W hether proving themselves am ong 
rough barbarian tribes or scrabbling to survive in the 
slums of larger cities, half-orcs get by on their physical 
might, their endurance, and the sheer determination 
they inherit from their human ancestry.
H a l f - O r c  N a m e s
Half-orcs usually have names appropriate to the culture 
in which they were raised. A half-orc w ho wants to fit in 
am ong humans might trade an orc name for a human 
name. Som e half-orcs with human names decide to 
adopt a guttural orc name because they think it makes 
them m ore intimidating.
Male Orc Names: Dench, Feng, Gell, Henk, Holg, Imsh, 
Keth, Krusk, Mhurren, Ront, Shump, Thokk 
Female Orc Names: Baggi, Emen, Engong, Kansif,

Your half-orc character has certain traits deriving from 
your ore ancestry.
hate orcs. Some are reserved, trying not to draw attention to 
themselves. A few demonstrate piety and good-heartedness 
as publicly as they can (whether or not such demonstrations 
are genuine). And some simply try to be so tough that others 
just avoid them.
Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score 
increases by 2, and your Constitution score 
increases by 1.
Age. Half-orcs mature a little faster than humans, 
reaching adulthood around age 14. They age 
noticeably faster and rarely live longer than 75 years.
Alignment. Half-orcs inherit a tendency toward chaos 
from their orc parents and are not strongly inclined 
toward good. Half-orcs raised am ong ores and willing 
to live out their lives among them are usually evil.
Size. Half-orcs are som ewhat larger and bulkier than 
humans, and they range from 5 to well over 6 feet tall. 
Your size is Medium.
Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
Darkvision. Thanks to your orc blood, you have 
superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can 
see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it w ere bright 
light, and in darkness as if it w ere dim light. You can't 
discern color in darkness, only shades o f gray.
Menacing. You gain proficiency in the 
Intimidation skill.
Relentless Endurance. W hen you are reduced to 
0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit 
point instead. You can’t use this feature again until you 
finish a long rest.
Savage Attacks. W hen you score a critical hit with 
a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon’s 
damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra 
damage of the critical hit.
Languages. You can speak, read, and 
write Com m on and Orc . Orc is a 
harsh, grating language with 
hard consonants. It has 
no script of its own 
but is written in the 
Dwarvish script.
“ B u t  y o u  d o  se e t h e  w a y  p e o p l e  l o o k  a t  y o u , 
devil’s child."
Those black eyes, cold as a winter storm, were staring 
right into her heart and the sudden seriousness in his 
voice 
jolted her.
“What is it they say?" he asked. “One’s a curiosity, two’
s 
a conspiracy—”
“Three's a curse,” she 
finished. “You think I haven’t heard 
that rubbish before?”
“I  
know 
y o u  
have.” When she glared at him, he added, 
“It’
s not as if 
I’m plumbing the depths of 
your mind, dear 
girl. That is the burden of 
every tiefling. Some break under 
it, some make it the millstone around their neck, some 
revel in it.” He tilted his head again, scrutinizing her, with
that wicked glint in his eyes. “You 
fight it, don’t 
you? Like 
a little wildcat, I wager. Every little 
jab and comment 
just 
sharpens 
your claws.”
—Erin M . Evans, Brimstone Angels
To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer 
violence and insult on the street, to see mistrust and 
fear in every eye: this is the lot of the tiefling. And to 
twist the knife, tieflings know that this is because a 
pact struck generations ago infused the essence of 
A sm odeus—overlord of the Nine Hells—into their 
bloodline. Their appearance and their nature are not 
their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which 
they and their children and their children’s children 
will always be held accountable.
I n f e r n a l  B l o o d l i n e
Tieflings are derived from human bloodlines, and in the 
broadest possible sense, they still look human. However, 
their infernal heritage has left a clear imprint on their 
appearance. Tieflings have large horns that take any 
of a variety of shapes: som e have curling horns like a 
ram, others have straight and tall horns like a gazelle’s, 
and som e spiral upward like an antelopes’ horns. They 
have thick tails, four to five feet long, which lash or coil 
around their legs when they get upset or nervous. Their 
canine teeth are sharply pointed, and their eyes are 
solid colors—black, red, white, silver, or gold—with no 
visible sclera or pupil. Their skin tones cover the full 
range of human coloration, but also include various 
shades of red. Their hair, cascading down from behind 
their horns, is usually dark, from  black or brown to dark 
red, blue, or purple.
S e l f - R e l i a n t  a n d  S u s p i c i o u s
Tieflings subsist in small minorities found mostly in 
human cities or towns, often in the roughest quarters 
of those places, where they grow up to be swindlers,
thieves, or crim e lords. Som etim es they live among 
other minority populations in enclaves where they are 
treated with m ore respect.
Lacking a homeland, tieflings know that they have 
to make their own way in the w orld and that they have 
to be strong to survive. They are not quick to trust 
anyone w ho claim s to be a friend, but when a tiefling’s 
com panions demonstrate that they trust him or her, 
the tiefling learns to extend the same trust to them. 
And once a tiefling gives som eone loyalty, the tiefling 
is a firm friend or ally for life.
T i e f l i n g  N a m e s  
Tiefling nam es fall into three broad categories. Tieflings 
born into another culture typically have nam es reflective 
of that culture. Som e have names derived from the 
Infernal language, passed down through generations, 
that reflect their fiendish heritage. And som e younger 
tieflings, striving to find a place in the world, adopt a 
name that signifies a virtue or other concept and then 
try to em body that concept. For som e, the chosen name 
is a noble quest. For others, it’s a grim destiny.
Male Infernal Names: Akm enos, Am non, Barakas, 
Damakos, Ekemon, Iados, Kairon, Leucis, Melech, 
Mordai, M orthos, Pelaios, Skam os, Therai 
Female Infernal Names: Akta, Anakis, Bryseis, Criella, 
Damaia, Ea, Kallista, Lerissa, Makaria, Nemeia, 
Orianna, Phelaia, Rieta 
“Virtue” Names: Art, Carrion, Chant, Creed, Despair, 
Excellence, Fear, Glory, Hope, Ideal, Music, Nowhere, 
Open, Poetry, Quest, Random, Reverence, Sorrow, 
Temerity, Torment, W eary
M u t u a l  M i s t r u s t
People tend to be suspicious of tieflings, assuming that 
their infernal heritage has left its mark on their personality 
and morality, not just their appearance. Shopkeepers keep 
a close eye on their goods when tieflings enter their stores, 
the town watch might follow a tiefling around for a while, 
and demagogues blame tieflings for strange happenings.
The reality, though, is that a tiefling’s bloodline doesn’t affect 
his or her personality to any great degree. Years of dealing 
with mistrust does leave its mark on most tieflings, and they 
respond to it in different ways. Some choose to live up to the 
wicked stereotype, but others are virtuous. Most are simply 
very aware of how people respond to them. After dealing with 
this mistrust throughout youth, a tiefling often develops the 
ability to overcome prejudice through charm or intimidation.
T i e f l i n g  T r a i t s
Tieflings share certain racial traits as a result of their 
infernal descent.
Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score 
increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 2.
Age. Tieflings mature at the same rate as humans but 
live a few years longer.
Alignment. Tieflings might not have an innate 
tendency toward evil, but many of them end up there. 
Evil or not, an independent nature inclines many 
tieflings toward a chaotic alignment.
Size. Tieflings are about the sam e size and build as 
humans. Your size is Medium.
Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
Darkvision. Thanks to your infernal heritage, you 
have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You 
can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were 
bright light, and in darkness as if it w ere dim light. You 
can’t discern color in darkness, only shades o f gray.
Hellish Resistance. You have resistance 
to fire damage.
Infernal Legacy. You know the thaumaturgy cantrip. 
Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the hellish 
rebuke spell once per day as a 2nd-level spell. Once you 
reach 5th level, you can also cast the darkness spell 
once per day. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for 
these spells.
Languages. You can speak, read, and write Com m on 
and Infernal.

DVENTURERS ARE EXTRAORDINARY PEOPLE,
 
driven by a thirst for excitement into a 
 life that others w ould never dare lead.
 
They are heroes, com pelled to explore the 
 
dark places of the world and take on the
challenges that lesser w om en and men 
can’t stand against.
Class is the primary definition of what your character 
can do. It’s m ore than a profession; it’s your character’s 
calling. Class shapes the way you think about the 
world and interact with it and your relationship with 
other people and powers in the multiverse. A fighter, 
for example, might view the world in pragmatic terms 
of strategy and maneuvering, and see herself as just a 
pawn in a much larger game. A cleric, by contrast, might 
see him self as a willing servant in a god’s unfolding plan 
or a conflict brewing am ong various deities. W hile the 
fighter has contacts in a m ercenary com pany or army, 
the cleric might know a number of priests, paladins, and 
devotees w ho share his faith.
Your class gives you a variety of special features, such 
as a fighter’s mastery of w eapons and armor, and a 
wizard’s spells. At low levels, your class gives you only 
two or three features, but as you advance in level you 
gain m ore and your existing features often improve. 
Each class entry in this chapter includes a table 
summ arizing the benefits you gain at every level, and 
a detailed explanation of each one.
Adventurers som etim es advance in m ore than one 
class. A rogue might switch direction in life and swear 
the oath of a paladin. A barbarian might discover latent 
magical ability and dabble in the sorcerer class while 
continuing to advance as a barbarian. Elves are known 
to com bine martial mastery with m agical training 
and advance as fighters and w izards simultaneously. 
Optional rules for com bining classes in this way, called 
multiclassing, appear in chapter 6.
Twelve classes—listed in the Classes table—are found 
in almost every D&D world and define the spectrum  of 
typical adventurers.

A  tall human tribesman strides through a blizzard, 
draped in fur and hefting his axe. He laughs as he 
charges toward the frost giant w ho dared poach his 
people’s elk herd.
A half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her 
authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck 
with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals.
Frothing at the mouth, a dwarf slam s his helmet into 
the face of his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored 
elbow into the gut o f another.
These barbarians, different as they might be, are 
defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and 
unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger 
is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting 
assault of a storm, the churning turmoil o f the sea.
For som e, their rage springs from a com m union 
with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling 
reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every 
barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle 
frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and 
feats of strength.
P r i m a l  I n s t i n c t  
People of towns and cities take pride in how their 
civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if 
denying one’s ow n nature was a mark of superiority. To 
a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign 
of weakness. The strong em brace their animal nature- 
keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. 
Barbarians are uncom fortable when hedged in by walls 
and crowds. They thrive in the wilds o f their homelands: 
the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes 
live and hunt.
Barbarians com e alive in the chaos of combat.
They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, 
giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A 
barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few 
times without resting, but those few rages are usually 
sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.
A  L i f e  o f  D a n g e r  
Not every m em ber of the tribes deem ed “barbarians” 
by scions of civilized society has the barbarian class. A 
true barbarian am ong these people is as uncom m on as 
a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar 
role as a protector of the people and a leader in times 
of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught 
with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying
monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger 
so that their people don’t have to.
Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians 
perfectly suited for adventuring. W andering is often a 
way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of 
the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Som e 
barbarians m iss the close-knit family structures of the 
tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds 
formed among the mem bers of their adventuring parties.
C r e a t i n g  a  B a r b a r i a n  
W hen creating a barbarian character, think about where 
your character com es from  and his or her place in the 
world. Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin 
for your barbarian. Did you com e from  a distant land, 
making you a stranger in the area of the campaign?
Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier 
where barbarians are com m on?
What led you to take up the adventuring life? W ere you 
lured to settled lands by the prom ise of riches? Did you 
join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared 
threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you 
out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? 
Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to 
“civilized” lands and only now able to win your freedom. 
Or you might have been cast out from your people 
because of a crim e you committed, a taboo you violated, 
or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.
Q u i c k  B u i l d
You can make a barbarian quickly by following these 
suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in 
Strength, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the 
outlander background.

th e e q u ip m e n t g r a n te d  b y  y o u r  b a c k g ro u n d :
•
 (a) a greataxe or (b) any martial melee weapon
•
 (a) two handaxes or (b) any simple weapon 
•
 An explorer’s pack and four javelins
R a g e  
In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, 
you can enter a rage as a bonus action.
W hile raging, you gain the following benefits if you 
aren’t w earing heavy armor:
•
 You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength 
saving throws.
•
 When you make a melee weapon attack using 
Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that 
increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown 
in the Rage Damage colum n of the Barbarian table.
•
 You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and 
slashing damage.
If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or 
concentrate on them while raging.
Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are 
knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you 
haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn 
or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage 
on your turn as a bonus action.
Once you have raged the number of times shown 
for your barbarian level in the Rages colum n of the 
Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you 
can rage again.
U n a r m o r e d  D e f e n s e
W hile you are not wearing any armor, your Arm or Class 
equals 10 + your Dexterity m odifier + your Constitution 
modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.
R e c k l e s s  A t t a c k
Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern 
for defense to attack with fierce desperation. W hen 
you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide 
to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on 
melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this 
turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until 
your next turn.
D a n g e r  S e n s e
At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things 
nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge 
when you dodge away from danger.
You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws 
against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. 
To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or 
incapacitated.
P r i m a l  P a t h
At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of 
your rage. C hoose the Path of the Berserker or the Path 
of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end of the 
class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd 
level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.
Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that 
it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you 
choose to end it.
I n d o m i t a b l e  M i g h t  
Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength 
check is less than your Strength score, you can use that 
score in place of the total.
P r i m a l  C h a m p i o n  
At 20th level, you em body the power of the wilds. Your 
Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your 
maximum for those scores is now 24.
Pr i m a l  Pa t h s
Rage burns in every barbarian’s heart, a furnace 
that drives him or her toward greatness. Different
A b i l i t y  S c o r e  I m p r o v e m e n t
W hen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, 
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your 
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of 
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability 
score above 20 using this feature.
E x t r a  A t t a c k  
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of 
once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
F a s t  M o v e m e n t
Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet 
while you aren’t w earing heavy armor.
F e r a l  I n s t i n c t
By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have 
advantage on initiative rolls.
Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of 
combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally 
on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before 
doing anything else on that turn.
B r u t a l  C r i t i c a l  
Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional 
weapon damage die when determining the extra 
damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.
This increases to two additional dice at 13th level 
and three additional dice at 17th level.
R e l e n t l e s s  R a g e  
Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting 
despite grievous w ounds. If you drop to 0 hit points 
while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make 
a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you 
drop to 1 hit point instead.
Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC 
increases by 5. W hen you finish a short or long rest, the 
DC resets to 10.
barbarians attribute their rage to different sources, 
however. For som e, it is an internal reservoir where 
pain, grief, and anger are forged into a fury hard as 
steel. Others see it as a spiritual blessing, a gift of 
a totem animal.
P a t h  o f  t h e  B e r s e r k e r
For som e barbarians, rage is a means to an end-—
that 
end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path 
of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter 
the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, 
heedless of your own health or well-being.
F r e n z y
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you 
can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for 
the duration of your rage you can make a single melee 
weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns 
after this one. W hen your rage ends, you suffer one level 
of exhaustion (as described in appendix A).
M i n d l e s s  R a g e
Beginning at 6th level, you can’t be charm ed or 
frightened while raging. If you are charm ed or 
frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is 
suspended for the duration of the rage.
I n t i m i d a t i n g  P r e s e n c e
Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to 
frighten som eone with your menacing presence.
W hen you do so, choose one creature that you can see 
within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear 
you, it must succeed on a W isdom  saving throw (DC 
equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma 
modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your 
next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action 
to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened
P e r s i s t e n t  R a g e
creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends 
if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or m ore 
than 60 feet away from you.
If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't 
use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.
R e t a l i a t i o n
Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from 
a creature that is within 5 feet of you. you can use 
your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against 
that creature.
P a t h  o f  t h e  T o t e m  W a r r i o r
The Path of the Totem W arrior is a spiritual journey, as 
the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, 
and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you 
with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your 
barbarian rage.
Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be 
kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for 
an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit, 
though exceptions exist.
S p i r i t  S e e k e r
Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural 
world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when 
you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the beast 
sense and speak with animals spells, but only as rituals, 
as described in chapter 10.
T o t e m  S p i r i t
At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a 
totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or 
acquire a physical totem object- an amulet or similar 
adornment—that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, 
teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you 
also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent 
of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear 
totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick- 
skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn 
bright yellow.
Your totem animal might be an animal related to those 
listed here but m ore appropriate to your homeland.
For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in 
place o f an eagle.
Bear. W hile raging, you have resistance to all damage 
except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you 
tough enough to stand up to any punishment.
Eagle. W hile you're raging and aren’t wearing 
heavy armor, other creatures have disadvantage on 
opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the 
Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. The spirit 
of the eagle m akes you into a predator w ho can weave 
through the fray with ease.
Wolf, W hile you're raging, your friends have 
advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature 
within 5 feet of you that is hostile to you. The spirit of 
the w olf makes you a leader of hunters.
A s p e c t  o f  t h e  B e a s t
At 6th level, you gain a m agical benefit based on the 
totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same 
animal you selected at 3rd level or a different one.
Bear. You gain the might of a bear. Your carrying 
capacity (including maximum load and maximum lift) 
is doubled, and you have advantage on Strength checks 
made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.
Eagle. You gain the eyesight of an eagle. You can 
see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty, able to discern 
even fine details as though looking at som ething no 
more than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim 
light doesn't im pose disadvantage on your W isdom  
(Perception) checks.
Wolf, You gain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf. You 
can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace, 
and you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal 
pace (see chapter 8 for rules on travel pace).
S p i r i t  W a l k e r
At 10th level, you can cast the commune with nature 
spell, but only as a ritual. W hen you do so, a spiritual 
version of one of the animals you chose for Totem Spirit 
or Aspect of the Beast appears to you to convey the 
information you seek.
T o t e m i c  A t t u n e m e n t
At 14th level, you gain a magical benefit based on a 
totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same 
animal you selected previously or a different one.
Bear, W hile you’re raging, any creature within 5 feet 
o f you that’s hostile to you has disadvantage on attack 
rolls against targets other than you or another character 
with this feature. An enemy is immune to this effect if it 
can’t see or hear you or if it can’t be frightened.
Eagle. W hile raging, you have a flying speed equal to 
your current walking speed. This benefit works only in 
short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and 
nothing else is holding you aloft.
Wolf. W hile you’re raging, you can use a bonus action 
on your turn to knock a Large or smaller creature prone 
when you hit it with melee weapon attack.
In the worlds of D&D, w ords and music are 
not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with 
power all their own. The bard is a master of song, 
speech, and the m agic they contain. Bards say 
that the multiverse w as spoken into existence, that the 
words o f the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these 
primordial W ords o f Creation still resound throughout 
the cosm os. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch 
and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their 
spells and powers.
The greatest strength of bards is their sheer 
versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines 
in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and 
hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable 
of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using 
their m agic to bolster their sw ords and armor. Their 
spells lean toward charm s and illusions rather than 
blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging 
knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude 
that lets them do almost anything well. Bards becom e 
masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, 
from musical perform ance to esoteric knowledge.
L e a r n i n g  f r o m  E x p e r i e n c e
True bards are not com m on in the world. Not every 
minstrel singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal 
court is a bard. Discovering the magic hidden in music 
requires hard study and som e measure of natural talent 
that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard 
to spot the difference between these perform ers and true 
bards, though. A bard’s life is spent wandering across 
the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the 
gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. 
But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a 
touch of magic set bards apart from their fellows.
Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and 
their natural desire to travel—to find new tales to tell, 
new skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the 
horizon—makes an adventuring career a natural calling. 
Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a 
variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost
Ba r d
Humming as she traces her fingers over an ancient 
monument in a long-forgotten ruin, a half-elf in rugged 
leathers finds knowledge springing into her mind, 
conjured forth by the magic of her song—knowledge 
of the people who constructed the monument and the 
mythic saga it depicts.
A stern human warrior bangs his sword rhythmically 
against his scale mail, setting the tempo for his war chant 
and exhorting his com panions to bravery and heroism. 
The magic of his song fortifies and em boldens them.
Laughing as she tunes her cittern, a gnom e weaves 
her subtle magic over the assem bled nobles, ensuring 
that her com panions’ words will be well received.
W hether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves 
magic through w ords and music to inspire allies, 
dem oralize foes, manipulate minds, create 
illusions, and even heal wounds.
M u s i c  a n d  M a g i c
works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange 
places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to 
accom pany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A 
bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal 
experience earns renown am ong other bards. Indeed, 
after telling so many stories about heroes accom plishing 
mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart 
and assume heroic roles themselves.
P r o f i c i e n c i e s
Armor: Light armor
Weapons: Simple weapons, hand crossbow s, 
longswords, rapiers, shortswords 
Tools: Three musical instruments of your choice
Saving Throws: Dexterity, Charisma 
Skills: Choose any three
C r e a t i n g  a  B a r d
Bards thrive on stories, whether those stories are true 
or not. Your character’s background and motivations 
are not as important as the stories that he or she tells 
about them. Perhaps you had a secure and mundane 
childhood. There’s no good story to be told about that, 
so you might paint yourself as an orphan raised by a hag 
in a dismal swamp. Or your childhood might be worthy 
of a story. Som e bards acquire their magical music 
through extraordinary means, including the inspiration 
of fey or other supernatural creatures.
Did you serve an apprenticeship, studying under a 
master, following the m ore experienced bard until you 
were ready to strike out on your own? Or did you attend 
a college where you studied bardic lore and practiced 
your musical magic? Perhaps you were a young runaway 
or orphan, befriended by a wandering bard w ho becam e 
your mentor. Or you might have been a spoiled noble 
child tutored by a master. Perhaps you stumbled into the 
clutches of a hag, making a bargain for a musical gift in 
addition to your life and freedom, but at what cost?
E q u i p m e n t
You start with the following equipment, in addition to 
the equipment granted by your background:
•
 (a) a rapier, (b) a longsword, or (c) any simple weapon
•
 (a) a diplomat’s pack or (b) an entertainer's pack
•
 (a) a lute or (b) any other musical instrument
•
 Leather armor and a dagger
S p e l l c a s t i n g
You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of 
reality in harmony with your wishes and music. Your 
spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you 
can tune to different situations. S ee chapter 10 for the 
general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the 
bard spell list.
C a n t r i p s
You know two cantrips of your choice from  the bard 
spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your 
choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known 
colum n of the Bard table.
C lass F e a t u r e s
As a bard, you gain the following class features.
H i t  P o i n t s
Hit Dice: 1d8 per bard level
Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier 
Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your 
Constitution modifier per bard level after 1st
Q u i c k  B u i l d
You can make a bard quickly by 
following these suggestions. First,
Charisma should be your highest 
ability score, followed by Dexterity.
Second, choose the entertainer 
background. Third, choose the dancing lights and 
vicious mockery cantrips, along with the following 
1st-level spells: charm person, detect magic, healing 
word, and thunderwave.
S p e l l  S l o t s
The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to 
cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of 
these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level 
or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you 
finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure 
wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot 
available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.
S p e l l s  K n o w n  o f  1s t  L e v e l  a n d  H i g h e r
You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the 
bard spell list.
The Spells Known colum n of the Bard table shows 
when you learn m ore bard spells of your choice. Each of 
these spells must be of a level for which you have spell 
slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you 
reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell 
of 1st or 2nd level.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you 
can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace 
it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also 
must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
S p e l l c a s t i n g  A b i l i t y
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard 
spells. Your magic com es from the heart and soul you 
pour into the perform ance of your music or oration.
You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your 
spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma
modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard 
spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
your Charisma modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + 
your Charisma modifier
R i t u a l  C a s t i n g
You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that 
spell has the ritual tag.
S p e l l c a s t i n g  F o c u s
You can use a musical instrument (found in chapter 5) 
as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.
B a r d i c  I n s p i r a t i o n
You can inspire others through stirring w ords or music. 
To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose 
one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you 
who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic 
Inspiration die, a d6.
Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll 
the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, 
attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can 
wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the 
Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM 
says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic 
Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have 
only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal 
to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You 
regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.
Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach 
certain levels in this class. The die becom es a d8 at 5th 
level, a d 10 at 10th level, and a d l2  at 15th level.
J a c k  o f  A l l  T r a d e s
Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency 
bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that 
doesn’t already include your proficiency bonus.
S o n g  o f  R e s t
Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or 
oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during 
a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures w ho can 
hear your perform ance regain hit points at the end of 
the short rest, each of those creatures regains an extra 
1d6 hit points.
The extra hit points increase when you reach certain 
levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d 10 at 13th 
level, and to 1d 12 at 17th level.
B a r d  C o l l e g e
At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of 
a bard college of your choice: the College of Lore or the 
College of Valor, both detailed at the end of the class 
description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level 
and again at 6th and 14th level.
E x p e r t i s e  
At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your 
proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you 
make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.
At 10th level, you can choose another two skill 
proficiencies to gain this benefit.
A b i l i t y  S c o r e  I m p r o v e m e n t
W hen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, 
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your 
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of 
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability 
score above 20 using this feature.
F o n t  o f  I n s p i r a t i o n
Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of 
your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you 
finish a short or long rest.
C o u n t e r c h a r m
At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or 
words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As 
an action, you can start a perform ance that lasts until 
the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any 
friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage 
on saving throws against being frightened or charmed.
A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. 
The perform ance ends early if you are incapacitated or 
silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).
M a g i c a l  S e c r e t s
By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge 
from  a wide spectrum  of disciplines. C hoose two spells 
from  any class, including this one. A spell you choose 
must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard 
table, or a cantrip.
The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are 
included in the number in the Spells Known colum n of 
the Bard table.
You learn two additional spells from any class at 14th 
level and again at 18th level.
S u p e r i o r  I n s p i r a t i o n
At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses 
of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.
Ba r d  C o ll e g e s
The way of a bard is gregarious. Bards seek each 
other out to swap songs and stories, boast o f their 
accomplishments, and share their knowledge. Bards 
form loose associations, which they call colleges, to 
facilitate their gatherings and preserve their traditions.
C o l l e g e  o f  L o r e  
Bards of the College o f Lore know som ething about 
m ost things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources 
as diverse as scholarly tom es and peasant tales. 
W hether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate 
com positions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts 
to hold audiences spellbound. W hen the applause dies 
down, the audience m em bers might find themselves 
questioning everything they held to be true, from their 
faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their 
loyalty to the king.
The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty 
and truth, not in fealty to a m onarch or following the 
tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a 
herald or advisor knows that the bard w ould rather be 
honest than politic.
The college’s m em bers gather in libraries and 
som etim es in actual colleges, complete with classroom s 
and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. 
They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they 
can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self- 
important figures of authority.
B o n u s  P r o f i c i e n c i e s
W hen you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain 
proficiency with three skills o f your choice.
C u t t i n g  W o r d s
Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to 
distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and 
com petence of others. W hen a creature that you can 
see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability 
check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to 
expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling 
a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number 
rolled from the creature’s roll. You can choose to use 
this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before 
the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability
check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its 
damage. The creature is immune if it can’t hear you or if 
it’s immune to being charmed.
A d d i t i o n a l  M a g i c a l  S e c r e t s
At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any 
class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, 
as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen 
spells count as bard spells for you but don’t count 
against the number of bard spells you know.
P e e r l e s s  S k i l l
Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, 
you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a 
Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to 
your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roil 
the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells you 
whether you succeed or fail.
C o l l e g e  o f  V a l o r
Bards of the College of Valor are daring skalds whose 
tales keep alive the m em ory of the great heroes of the 
past, and thereby inspire a new generation of heroes. 
These bards gather in mead halls or around great 
bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past 
and present. They travel the land to witness great 
events firsthand and to ensure that the m em ory of 
those events doesn’t pass from the world. With their
songs, they inspire others to reach the same heights of 
accomplishment as the heroes of old.
B o n u s  P r o f i c i e n c i e s
When you join the College of Valor at 3rd level, you 
gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and 
martial weapons.
C o m b a t  I n s p i r a t i o n
Also at 3rd level, you learn to inspire others in battle.
A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from  you 
can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon 
damage roll it just made. Alternatively, when an attack 
roll is made against the creature, it can use its reaction

Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of 
once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
B a t t l e  M a g i c
At 14th level, you have mastered the art of weaving 
spellcasting and weapon use into a single harm onious 
act. W hen you use your action to cast a bard spell, you 
can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world 
and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods 
they serve, clerics strive to em body the handiwork of 
their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with 
divine magic.
H e a l e r s  a n d  W a r r i o r s
Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of 
the gods, flowing from them into the world. Clerics are 
conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous 
effects. The gods don’t grant this power to everyone who 
 
seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.
Harnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on study or 
training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and 
ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on 
devotion and an intuitive sense o f a deity’s wishes.
Clerics com bine the helpful magic o f healing and 
inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder 
foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of 
plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven 
to consum e their enemies. For those evildoers who will 
benefit most from a m ace to the head, clerics depend on 
their com bat training to let them wade into melee with 
the power of the gods on their side.
D i v i n e  A g e n t s
Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a 
cleric. Som e priests are called to a simple life o f temple 
service, carrying out their gods’ will through prayer and 
sacrifice, not by m agic and strength o f arms. In som e 
cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed 
as a stepping stone to higher positions o f authority and 
involving no com m union with a god at all. True clerics 
are rare in most hierarchies.
W hen a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually 
because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals 
of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the 
walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in 
ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect
their deities’ worshipers, which can mean fighting 
rampaging orc s, negotiating peace between warring 
nations, or sealing a portal that w ould allow a demon 
prince to enter the world.
M ost adventuring clerics maintain som e connection to 
established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple 
might ask for a cleric’s aid, or a high priest might be in a 
position to demand it.
C r e a t i n g  a  C l e r i c
As you create a cleric, the m ost important question to 
consider is which deity to serve and what principles you 
want your character to embody. Appendix B includes 
lists of many of the gods of the multiverse. Check with 
your DM to learn which deities are in your campaign.
Once you’ve chosen a deity, consider your cleric's 
relationship to that god. Did you enter this service 
willingly? Or did the god choose you, impelling you into 
service with no regard for your wishes? H ow do the 
temple priests of your faith regard you: as a champion 
or a troublemaker? W hat are your ultimate goals? D oes 
your deity have a special task in mind for you? Or are 
you striving to prove yourself worthy of a great quest?
Q u i c k  B u i l d
You can make a cleric quickly by following these 
suggestions. First, W isdom  should be your highest 
ability score, followed by Strength or Constitution. 
Second, choose the acolyte background.

S p e l l c a s t i n g
As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. 
See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and 
chapter 11 for the cleric spell list.
C a n t r i p s
At 1st level, you know three cantrips o f your choice from 
the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips 
of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips 
Known colum n of the Cleric table.
P r e p a r i n g  a n d  C a s t i n g  S p e l l s
The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have 
to cast your spells o f 1st level and higher. To cast one of 
these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level 
or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you 
finish a long rest.
You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available 
for you to cast, choosing from  the cleric spell list. W hen 
you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to 
your W isdom  modifier + your cleric level (minimum of 
one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you 
have spell slots.
For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 
1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a W isdom  
of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells 
of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare 
the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using 
a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t 
remove it from your list of prepared spells.
You can change your list of prepared spells when you 
finish a long rest. Preparing a new list o f cleric spells 
requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 
minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
S p e l l c a s t i n g  A b i l i t y
W isdom  is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. 
The power of your spells com es from your devotion to 
your deity. You use your W isdom  whenever a cleric spell 
refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use 
your W isdom  m odifier when setting the saving throw 
DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an 
attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
your Wisdom modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + 
your Wisdom modifier
R i t u a l  C a s t i n g
You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the 
ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
S p e l l c a s t i n g  F o c u s
You can use a holy sym bol (found in chapter 5) as a 
spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.
D i v i n e  D o m a i n
Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, 
Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each 
dom ain is detailed at the end of the class description, 
and each one provides examples of gods associated 
with it. Your choice grants you dom ain spells and other 
features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants 
you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you 
gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 
6th, 8th, and 17th levels.
D o m a i n  S p e l l s
Each dom ain has a list of spells—its dom ain spells— 
that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain 
description. Once you gain a dom ain spell, you always 
have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the 
number of spells you can prepare each day.
If you have a dom ain spell that doesn’t appear on the 
cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.
C h a n n e l  D i v i n i t y
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine 
energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel 
magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn 
Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Som e 
dom ains grant you additional effects as you advance in 
levels, as noted in the dom ain description.
W hen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose 
which effect to create. You must then finish a short or 
long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.
S om e Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. 
W hen you use such an effect from  this class, the DC 
equals your cleric spell save DC.
Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel 
Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level.
you can use it three times between rests. W hen you finish 
a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.
C h a n n e l  D i v i n i t y : T u r n  U n d e a d  
As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a 
prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see 
or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a W isdom  
saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is 
turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.
A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move 
as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly 
move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take 
reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action 
or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from 
moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use 
the Dodge action.
A b i l i t y  S c o r e  I m p r o v e m e n t
W hen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, 
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your 
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of 
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability 
score above 20 using this feature.
D e s t r o y  U n d e a d
Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving 
throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is 
instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a 
certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.

Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to 
intervene on your behalf when your need is great.
Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your 
action. D escribe the assistance you seek, and roll 
percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower 
than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM 
chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any 
cleric spell or cleric dom ain spell w ould be appropriate.
If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature 
again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after 
you finish a long rest.
At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds 
automatically, no roll required.
D i v i n e  D o m a i n s
In a pantheon, every deity has influence over different 
aspects of mortal life and civilization, called a deity’s 
domain. All the dom ains over which a deity has 
influence are called the deity’s portfolio. For example, 
the portfolio of the Greek god Apollo includes the
dom ains of Knowledge, Life, and Light. As a cleric, you 
choose one aspect of your deity’s portfolio to emphasize, 
and you are granted powers related to that domain.
Your choice might correspond to a particular sect 
dedicated to your deity. Apollo, for example, could be 
worshiped in one region as Phoebus (“radiant”) Apollo, 
emphasizing his influence over the Light domain, 
and in a different place as Apollo Acesius (“healing”), 
emphasizing his association with the Life domain. 
Alternatively, your choice of dom ain could simply be a 
matter of personal preference, the aspect o f the deity 
that appeals to you most.
Each dom ain’s description gives examples of deities 
w ho have influence over that domain. G ods are included 
from the worlds of the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, 
Dragonlance, and Eberron campaign settings, as well as 
from the Celtic, Greek, Norse, and Egyptian pantheons 
o f antiquity.
K n o w l e d g e  D o m a i n
The gods of knowledge—including Oghma, B occob, 
Gilean, Aureon, and Thoth—value learning and 
understanding above all. Som e teach that knowledge is 
to be gathered and shared in libraries and universities, 
or promote the practical knowledge o f craft and 
invention. Som e deities hoard knowledge and keep its 
secrets to themselves. And som e prom ise their followers 
that they will gain tremendous pow er if they unlock the 
secrets o f the multiverse. Followers of these gods study 
esoteric lore, collect old tomes, delve into the secret 
places of the earth, and learn all they can. Som e gods 
of knowledge promote the practical knowledge of craft 
and invention, including smith deities like Gond, Reorx, 
Onatar, Moradin, Hephaestus, and Goibhniu.

At 1st level, you learn two languages of your choice.
You also becom e proficient in your choice o f two of the 
following skills: Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion.
Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check 
you make that uses either of those skills.
C h a n n e l  D i v i n i t y :

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity 
to tap into a divine well o f knowledge. As an action, 
you choose one skill or tool. For 10 minutes, you have 
proficiency with the chosen skill or tool.
C h a n n e l  D i v i n i t y : R e a d  T h o u g h t s  
At 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to read a 
creature’s thoughts. You can then use your access to the 
creature’s mind to com m and it.
As an action, choose one creature that you can see 
within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a 
W isdom  saving throw. If the creature succeeds on the 
saving throw, you can’t use this feature on it again until 
you finish a long rest.
If the creature fails its save, you can read its surface 
thoughts (those forem ost in its mind, reflecting its 
current em otions and what it is actively thinking 
about) when it is within 60 feet of you. This effect lasts 
for 1 minute.
During that time, you can use your action to end this 
effect and cast the suggestion spell on the creature 
without expending a spell slot. The target automatically 
fails its saving throw against the spell.
P o t e n t  S p e l l c a s t i n g
Starting at 8th level, you add your W isdom  modifier to 
the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.
V i s i o n s  o f  t h e  Pa s t
Starting at 17th level, you can call up visions of the 
past that relate to an object you hold or your immediate 
surroundings. You spend at least 1 minute in meditation 
and prayer, then receive dreamlike, shadowy glimpses 
of recent events. You can meditate in this way for a 
number of minutes equal to your W isdom  score and 
must maintain concentration during that time, as if you 
were casting a spell.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until 
you finish a short or long rest.
Object Reading. Holding an object as you meditate, 
you can see visions of the object’s previous owner.
After meditating for 1 minute, you learn how the owner 
acquired and lost the object, as well as the most recent 
significant event involving the object and that owner.
If the object w as owned by another creature in the 
recent past (within a number of days equal to your 
W isdom  score), you can spend 1 additional minute 
for each owner to learn the sam e information about 
that creature.
Area Reading. As you meditate, you see visions 
of recent events in your immediate vicinity (a room, 
street, tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 50-foot cube), 
going back a number of days equal to your W isdom  
score. For each minute you meditate, you learn about 
one significant event, beginning with the most recent. 
Significant events typically involve powerful emotions, 
such as battles and betrayals, marriages and murders, 
births and funerals. However, they might also include 
more mundane events that are nevertheless important 
in your current situation.
L i f e  D o m a i n  
The Life dom ain focuses on the vibrant positive 
energy—one o f the fundamental forces of the universe— 
that sustains all life. The gods o f life promote vitality 
and health through healing the sick and wounded, 
caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of 
death and undeath. Alm ost any non-evil deity can claim 
influence over this domain, particularly agricultural 
deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun 
gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods
B o n u s  P r o f i c i e n c y
W hen you choose this dom ain at 1st level, you gain 
proficiency with heavy armor.
D i s c i p l e  o f  L if e
A lso starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more 
effective. W henever you use a spell o f 1st level or higher 
to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains 
additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.
C h a n n e l  D i v i n i t y : P r e s e r v e  L if e
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity 
to heal the badly injured.
As an action, you present your holy symbol and 
evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit 
points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any 
creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit 
points am ong them. This feature can restore a creature 
to no m ore than half of its hit point maximum. You can’t 
use this feature on an undead or a construct.
B l e s s e d  H e a l e r
Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on 
others heal you as well. W hen you cast a spell of 1st 
level or higher that restores hit points to a creature 
other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the 
spell’s level.
D i v i n e  St r i k e
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your w eapon 
strikes with divine energy. Once on each o f your turns 
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can 
cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to 
the target. W hen you reach 14th level, the extra damage 
increases to 2d8.
S u p r e m e  H e a l i n g
Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll 
one or m ore dice to restore hit points with a spell, you 
instead use the highest number possible for each die. 
For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a 
creature, you restore 12.
L i g h t  D o m a i n
G ods o f light—including Helm, Lathander, Pholtus, 
Branchala, the Silver Flame, Belenus, Apollo, and 
Re-Horakhty—promote the ideals of rebirth and 
renewal, truth, vigilance, and beauty, often using the 
symbol of the sun. S om e of these gods are portrayed 
as the sun itself or as a charioteer who guides the sun
of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, 
Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of hom e and 
community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).

W a r d i n g  F l a r e
Also at 1st level, you can interpose divine light between 
yourself and an attacking enemy. W hen you are attacked 
by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, 
you can use your reaction to im pose disadvantage on 
the attack roll, causing light to flare before the attacker 
before it hits or m isses. An attacker that can’t be blinded 
is immune to this feature.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to 
your W isdom  modifier (a minimum of once). You regain 
all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
C h a n n e l  D i v i n i t y : R a d i a n c e  o f  t h e  D a w n
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity 
to harness sunlight, banishing darkness and dealing 
radiant damage to your foes.
As an action, you present your holy symbol, and any 
m agical darkness within 30 feet of you is dispelled. 
Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of 
you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature 
takes radiant damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level 
on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a 
successful one. A  creature that has total cover from you 
is not affected.
I m p r o v e d  F l a r e
Starting at 6th level, you can also use your W arding 
Flare feature when a creature that you can see within 
30 feet o f you attacks a creature other than you.
P o t e n t  S p e l l c a s t i n g
Starting at 8th level, you add your W isdom  m odifier to 
the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.
C o r o n a  o f  L i g h t
Starting at 17th level, you can use your action to activate 
an aura of sunlight that lasts for 1 minute or until you 
dism iss it using another action. You emit bright light in 
a 60-foot radius and dim light 30 feet beyond that. Your 
enem ies in the bright light have disadvantage on saving 
throws against any spell that deals fire or radiant damage.
N a t u r e  D o m a i n
G ods of nature are as varied as the natural world 
itself, from inscrutable gods of the deep forests (such 
as Silvanus, Obad-Hai, Chislev, Balinor, and Pan) to 
friendly deities associated with particular springs and 
groves (such as Eldath). Druids revere nature as a 
whole and might serve one of these deities, practicing 
mysterious rites and reciting all-but-forgotten prayers in 
their own secret tongue. But many of these gods have 
clerics as well, champions who take a m ore active role 
in advancing the interests o f a particular nature god. 
These clerics might hunt the evil monstrosities that 
despoil the w oodlands, bless the harvest of the faithful, 
or wither the crops of those w ho anger their gods.

L i g h t  D o m a i n  S p e l l s
A c o l y t e  o f  N a t u r e

a n d  P l a n t s
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity 
to charm animals and plants.
As an action, you present your holy symbol and invoke 
the name of your deity. Each beast or plant creature that 
can see you within 30 feet of you must make a W isdom  
saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is 
charm ed by you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. 
W hile it is charm ed by you, it is friendly to you and other 
creatures you designate.
D a m p e n  E l e m e n t s
Starting at 6th level, when you or a creature within 30 
feet of you takes acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder 
damage, you can use your reaction to grant resistance to 
the creature against that instance of the damage.
D i v i n e  St r i k e
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your w eapon 
strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns 
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you 
can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 cold, fire, or 
lightning damage (your choice) to the target. W hen you 
reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
M a s t e r  o f  N a t u r e
At 17th level, you gain the ability to com m and animals 
and plant creatures. W hile creatures are charm ed by 
your Charm Anim als and Plants feature, you can take

each of those creatures will do on its next turn.

G ods w hose portfolios include the Tempest d o m a in - 
including Talos, Umberlee, Kord, Zeboim , the 
Devourer, Zeus, and Thor—govern storms, sea, and 
sky. They include gods of lightning and thunder, gods 
o f earthquakes, som e fire gods, and certain gods of 
violence, physical strength, and courage. In som e 
pantheons, a god o f this dom ain rules over other deities 
and is known for swift justice delivered by thunderbolts. 
In the pantheons of seafaring people, gods of this 
dom ain are ocean deities and the patrons of sailors. 
Tempest gods send their clerics to inspire fear in the 
com m on folk, either to keep those folk on the path of
righteousness or to encourage them to offer sacrifices of 
propitiation to ward off divine wrath.

W r a t h  o f  t h e  St o r m
Also at 1st level, you can thunderously rebuke attackers.

hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to 
cause the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. 
The creature takes 2d8 lightning or thunder damage 
(your choice) on a failed saving throw, and half as much 
damage on a successful one.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to 
your W isdom  m odifier (a minimum of once). You regain 
all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
C h a n n e l  D i v i n i t y : D e s t r u c t i v e  W r a t h  
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity

St o r m b o r n
At 17th level, you have a flying speed equal to 
your current walking speed whenever you are not 
underground or indoors.
T r i c k e r y  D o m a i n
G ods of trickery—such as Tymora, Beshaba, 
Olidammara, the Traveler, Garl Glittergold, and 
Loki—are mischief-makers and instigators who stand 
as a constant challenge to the accepted order among 
both gods and mortals. They’re patrons of thieves, 
scoundrels, gamblers, rebels, and liberators. Their 
clerics are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing 
pride, m ocking tyrants, stealing from the rich, freeing 
captives, and flouting hollow traditions. They prefer
subterfuge, pranks, deception, and theft rather than 
direct confrontation.
T r i c k e r y  D o m a i n  S p e l l s
B l e s s i n g  o f  t h e  T r i c k s t e r  
Starting when you choose this dom ain at 1st level, you 
can use your action to touch a willing creature other 
than yourself to give it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) 
checks. This blessing lasts for 1 hour or until you use 
this feature again.
C h a n n e l  D i v i n i t y : I n v o k e  D u p l i c i t y
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity 
to create an illusory duplicate o f yourself.
As an action, you create a perfect illusion of 
yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your 
concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). 
The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you 
can see within 30 feet of you. As a bonus action on your 
turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space 
you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet o f you.
For the duration, you can cast spells as though you 
were in the illusion’s space, but you must use your own 
senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion 
are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, 
you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, 
given how distracting the illusion is to the target.
C h a n n e l  D i v i n i t y : C l o a k  o f  S h a d o w s
Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel 
Divinity to vanish.
As an action, you becom e invisible until the end of your 
next turn. You becom e visible if you attack or cast a spell.
D i v i n e  St r i k e
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your w eapon 
strikes with poison—a gift from your deity. Once on each 
of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon 
attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 
poison damage to the target. W hen you reach 14th level, 
the extra damage increases to 2d8.
I m p r o v e d  D u p l i c i t y
At 17th level, you can create up to four duplicates 
of yourself, instead of one, when you use Invoke 
Duplicity. As a bonus action on your turn, you can 
move any number of them up to 30 feet, to a maximum 
range of 120 feet.
W a r  D o m a i n  
War has many manifestations. It can make heroes of 
ordinary people. It can be desperate and horrific, with 
acts o f cruelty and cowardice eclipsing instances of 
excellence and courage. In either case, the gods of war
watch over warriors and reward them for their great 
deeds. The clerics of such gods excel in battle, inspiring 
others to fight the good fight or offering acts o f violence 
as prayers. G ods of war include cham pions of honor 
and chivalry (such as Torm, Heironeous, and Kiri- 
Jolith) as well as gods of destruction and pillage (such 
as Erythnul, the Fury, Gruumsh, and Ares) and gods of 
conquest and domination (such as Bane, Hextor, and 
Maglubiyet). Other war gods (such as Tempus, Nike, 
and Nuada) take a m ore neutral stance, prom oting war 
in all its manifestations and supporting w arriors in any 
circumstance.

D r u id
Holding high a gnarled staff wreathed with holly, an elf 
sum m ons the fury of the storm and calls down explosive 
bolts of lightning to smite the torch-carrying orc s who 
threaten her forest.
Crouching out o f sight on a high tree branch in the 
form of a leopard, a human peers out o f the jungle at the 
strange construction of a temple of Evil Elemental Air, 
keeping a close eye on the cultists’ activities.
Swinging a blade form ed of pure fire, a half-elf 
charges into a m ass o f skeletal soldiers, sundering 
the unnatural magic that gives the foul creatures the 
m ocking sem blance o f life.
W hether calling on the elemental forces of nature or 
emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are 
an embodim ent of nature’s resilience, cunning, and fury. 
They claim  no mastery over nature. Instead, they see 
themselves as extensions o f nature’s indomitable will.
P o w e r  o f  N a t u r e
Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and 
other magical powers either from  the force of nature 
itself or from  a nature deity. Many druids pursue a 
mystic spirituality o f transcendent union with nature 
rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others 
serve gods o f wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. 
The ancient druidic traditions are som etim es called 
the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship o f gods in 
temples and shrines.
Druid spells are oriented toward nature and anim als— 
the power of tooth and claw, of sun and m oon, of fire 
and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal 
forms, and som e druids make a particular study of this 
practice, even to the point where they prefer animal 
form  to their natural form.
P r e s e r v e  t h e  B a l a n c e
For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The 
four elements that make up a w orld—air, earth, fire,
and water—must remain in equilibrium. If one element 
were to gain power over the others, the world could be 
destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and 
broken apart into its com ponent elements. Thus, druids 
oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote 
one element to the exclusion of others.
Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological 
balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need 
for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in 
opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in 
nature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including 
aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers) 
and undead (such as zom bies and vampires). Druids 
som etim es lead raids against such creatures, especially 
when the monsters encroach on the druids’ territory.
Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or 
watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a 
significant danger arises, threatening nature’s balance 
or the lands they protect, druids take on a m ore active 
role in com bating the threat, as adventurers.
C r e a t i n g  a  D r u i d  
W hen making a druid, consider why your character has 
such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character 
lives in a society where the Old Faith still thrives, or was 
raised by a druid after being abandoned in the depths 
of a forest. Perhaps your character had a dramatic 
encounter with the spirits of nature, com ing face to 
face with a giant eagle or dire w olf and surviving the 
experience. Maybe your character w as born during an 
epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreted
as a sign that becom ing a druid 
was part of your character’s destiny.
Have you always been an adventurer 
as part of your druidic calling, or did you 
first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred 
grove or spring? Perhaps your homeland was 
befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in 
hopes of finding a new hom e or purpose.
Q u i c k  B u i l d
You can make a druid quickly by following these 
suggestions. First, W isdom  should be your highest 
ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose

Skills: C hoose two from  Arcana, Animal 
Handling, Insight, Medicine, Nature, Perception, 
Religion, and Survival
E q u i p m e n t
You start with the following equipment, in addition to 
the equipment granted by your background:
•
 (a) a w ooden shield or (b) any simple weapon 
•
 (a) a scim itar or (b) any simple melee weapon
•
 
Leather armor, an explorer’s pack, and a druidic focus
D r u i d i c
You know  Druidic, the secret language of druids. You 
can speak the language and use it to leave hidden 
m essages. You and others w ho know this language 
automatically spot such a message. Others spot the 
m essage’s presence with a successful DC 15 W isdom  
(Perception) check but can’t decipher it without magic.
S p e l l c a s t i n g
Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you 
can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See 
chapter 10 for the general rules o f spellcasting and 
chapter 11 for the druid spell list.
C a n t r i p s
At 1st level, you know  two cantrips of your choice from 
the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips 
o f your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips 
Known colum n of the Druid table.
P r e p a r i n g  a n d  C a s t i n g  S p e l l s
The Druid table show s how  many spell slots you have 
to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of 
these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s 
level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when 
you finish a long rest.
You prepare the list of druid spells that are available 
for you to cast, choosing from  the druid spell list. W hen 
you do so, choose a number o f druid spells equal to 
your W isdom  m odifier + your druid level (minimum of
S a c r e d  P l a n t s  a n d  W o o d
A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, 
ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, 
willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a 
spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or 
sprigs of mistletoe.
Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, 
such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death 
and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might 
be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak 
with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole 
weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. 
Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown 
weapons, such as darts or javelins.
Druids from regions that lack the plants described here 
have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For 
instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca 
tree and cactus plants.
one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you 
have spell slots.
For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 
1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a W isdom  
of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells 
of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare 
the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using 
a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t 
remove it from  your list of prepared spells.
You can also change your list of prepared spells when 
you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid 
spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at 
least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
S p e l l c a s t i n g  A b i l i t y
W isdom  is your spellcasting ability for your druid 
spells, since your m agic draws upon your devotion and 
attunement to nature. You use your W isdom  whenever 
a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, 
you use your W isdom  modifier when setting the saving 
throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an 
attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
your Wisdom modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + 
your Wisdom modifier
R i t u a l  C a s t i n g
You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the 
ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
S p e l l c a s t i n g  F o c u s
You can use a druidic focus (found in chapter 5) as a 
spellcasting focus for your druid spells.
W i l d  S h a p e
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to 
magically assume the shape of a beast that you have 
seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain 
expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
Your druid level determines the beasts you can 
transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 
2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast 
that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn’t 
have a flying or swim m ing speed.

You can stay in a beast shape for a number o f hours 
equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then 
revert to your normal form  unless you expend another 
use of this feature. You can revert to your normal 
form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You 
automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 
0 hit points, or die.
W hile you are transformed, the following rules apply:
•
 Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of 
the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, 
and Intelligence, W isdom , and Charisma scores. You 
also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficien- 
cies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If 
the creature has the same proficiency as you and the 
bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the 
creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has 
any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.
•
 W hen you transform, you assume the beast’s hit 
points and Hit Dice. W hen you revert to your normal 
form, you return to the number of hit points you had 
before you transformed. However, if you revert as a 
result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage 
carries over to your normal form. For example, if you 
take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit 
point left, you revert and take 9 damage. A s long as 
the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form 
to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.
•
 You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or 
take any action that requires hands is limited to the 
capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t 
break your concentration on a spell you’ve already 
cast, however, or prevent you from  taking actions that 
are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you’ve 
already cast.
•
 You retain the benefit of any features from  your class, 
race, or other source and can use them if the new 
form  is physically capable of doing so. However, you 
can’t use any o f your special senses, such as darkvi- 
sion, unless your new form also has that sense.
•
 You choose whether your equipment falls to the 
ground in your space, merges into your new form, or 
is worn by it. W orn equipment functions as normal, 
but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new 
form  to wear a piece of equipment, based on the crea- 
ture’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change 
size or shape to match the new 
form, and any equipment that 
the new form  can’t w ear 
must either fall to the 
ground or merge with it.
Equipment that merges 
with the form has no 
effect until you leave 
the form.
D r u i d  C i r c l e
At 2nd level, you choose to 
identify with a circle of druids: 
the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the M oon, both 
detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice 
grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, 
and 14th level.
A b i l i t y  S c o r e  I m p r o v e m e n t
W hen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, 
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of 
your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores 
of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an 
ability score above 20 using this feature.
Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield 
causes you to age m ore slowly. For every 10 years that 
pass, your body ages only 1 year.
B e a s t  S p e l l s
Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid 
spells in any shape you assume using W ild Shape. You 
can perform  the som atic and verbal com ponents of a 
druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able to 
provide material com ponents.
A r c h d r u i d
At 20th level, you can use your W ild Shape an unlimited 
num ber of times.
T i m e l e s s  B o d y
Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic 
com ponents of your druid spells, as well as any material 
com ponents that lack a cost and aren’t consum ed by a 
spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape 
and your beast shape from W ild Shape.
D r u id C ircles
Though their organization is invisible to most outsiders, 
druids are part of a society that spans the land, ignoring 
political borders. All druids are nominally m em bers 
of this druidic society, though som e individuals are so 
isolated that they have never seen any high-ranking 
m em bers of the society or participated in druidic 
gatherings. Druids recognize each other as brothers and 
sisters. Like creatures of the wilderness, however, druids 
som etim es compete with or even prey on each other.
At a local scale, druids are organized into circles that 
share certain perspectives on nature, balance, and the 
way o f the druid.
C i r c l e  o f  t h e  L a n d
The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages 
who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through 
a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred 
circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal 
secrets in Druidic. The circle’s w isest m em bers preside 
as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old 
Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk.
As a m em ber of this circle, your magic is influenced 
by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s 
mysterious rites.
B o n u s  C a n t r i p
W hen you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one 
additional druid cantrip of your choice.
N a t u r a l  R e c o v e r y
Starting at 2nd level, you can regain som e of your 
magical energy by sitting in meditation and com m uning 
with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended 
spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a 
com bined level that is equal to or less than half your 
druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 
6th level or higher. You can’t use this feature again until 
you finish a long rest 
For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can 
recover up to two levels w orth of spell slots. You can 
recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.
C i r c l e  S p e l l s
Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with 
the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 
9th level you gain access to circle spells connected 
to the land where you becam e a druid. C hoose that 
land—arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, 
swamp, or Underdark—and consult the associated 
list of spells.
Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have 
it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of 
spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a 
spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell 
is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

L a n d ’s St r i d e
Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical 
difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can 
also pass through nonm agical plants without being 
slowed by them and without taking damage from them if 
they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.
In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against 
plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede 
movement, such those created by the entangle spell.
N a t u r e ’s W a r d
W hen you reach 10th level, you can’t be charm ed or 
frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to 
poison and disease.
N a t u r e ’s S a n c t u a r y
W hen you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural 
world sense your connection to nature and becom e 
hesitant to attack you. W hen a beast or plant creature 
attacks you, that creature must make a W isdom  saving 
throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, 
the creature must choose a different target, or the attack 
automatically m isses. On a successful save, the creature 
is immune to this effect for 24 hours.
The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its 
attack against you.
C i r c l e  o f  t h e  M o o n
Druids of the Circle of the M oon are fierce guardians 
of the wilds. Their order gathers under the full m oon to 
share news and trade warnings. They haunt the deepest 
parts of the wilderness, where they might go for weeks 
on end before crossing paths with another humanoid 
creature, let alone another druid.
Changeable as the m oon, a druid of this circle might 
prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops 
as an eagle the next day, and crash through the 
undergrowth in bear form to drive off a trespassing 
monster. The wild is in the druid's blood.
C o m b a t  W i l d  S h a p e
W hen you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain the 
ability to use W ild Shape on your turn as a bonus action, 
rather than as an action.
Additionally, while you are transformed by W ild 
Shape, you can use a bonus action to expend one 
spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell 
slot expended.
C i r c l e  F o r m s
The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform 
into m ore dangerous animal forms. Starting at 2nd 
level, you can use your W ild Shape to transform into a 
beast with a challenge rating as high as 1 (you ignore 
the Max. CR colum n of the Beast Shapes table, but must 
abide by the other limitations there).
Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a beast 
with a challenge rating as high as your druid level 
divided by 3, rounded down.
P r i m a l  St r i k e
Starting at 6th level, your attacks in beast form count as 
magical for the purpose of overcom ing resistance and 
immunity to nonm agical attacks and damage.
E l e m e n t a l  W i l d  S h a p e
At 10th level, you can expend two uses of W ild Shape 
at the same time to transform into an air elemental, an 
earth elemental, a fire elemental, or a water elemental.
T h o u s a n d  F o r m s
By 14th level, you have learned to use magic to alter 
your physical form in m ore subtle ways. You can cast the 
alter self 
spell at will.
D r u i d s  a n d  t h e  G o d s
Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but 
most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities 
worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix 
B
 include many such deities). The worship of 
these deities 
is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths 
of clerics and urbanized peoples. In
 fact, in the world of 
Greyhawk, the druidic faith is called the Old Faith, and it 
claims many adherents among farmers, foresters, fishers, 
and others who live closely with nature. This tradition 
includes the worship of Nature as a primal force beyond 
personification, but also encompasses the worship of Beory, 
the Oerth Mother, as well as devotees of Obad-Hai, Ehlonna, 
and Ulaa.
In the worlds of Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms, 
druidic circles are not usually connected to the faith of a 
single nature deity. Any given circle in the Forgotten Realms, 
for example, might include druids who revere Silvanus,
Mielikki, Eldath, Chauntea, or even the harsh Gods of Fury: 
Talos, Malar, Auril, and Umberlee. These nature gods are 
often called the First Circle, the first among the druids, and 
most druids count them all (even the violent ones) as worthy 
of veneration.
The druids of Eberron hold animistic beliefs completely 
unconnected to the Sovereign Host, the Dark Six, or any of 
the other religions of the world. They believe that every living 
thing and every natural phenomenon— sun, moon, wind, 
fire, and the world itself—has a spirit. Their spells, then, are 
a means to communicate with and command these spirits. 
Different druidic sects, though, hold different philosophies 
about the proper relationship of these spirits to each other 
and to the forces of civilization. The Ashbound, for example, 
believe that arcane magic is an abomination against nature, 
the Children of 
Winter venerate the forces of death, and the 
Gatekeepers preserve ancient traditions meant to protect the 
world from the incursion of aberrations.
F i g h t e r
A human in clanging plate armor holds her shield 
before her as she runs toward the m assed goblins. An 
elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers 
the goblins with arrows loosed from  his exquisite 
bow. The half-orc nearby shouts orders, helping 
the two combatants coordinate their assault to the 
best advantage.
A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between 
the ogre’s club and his com panion, knocking the deadly 
blow aside. His companion, a half-elf in scale armor, 
swings two scim itars in a blinding whirl as she circles 
the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.
A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with 
his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving 
them around for the crow d’s delight—and his own 
tactical advantage. His opponent’s sword flares with 
blue light an instant before she sends lightning flashing 
forth to smite him.
All of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most 
diverse class of characters in the worlds of D u n g e o n s  & 
D r a g o n s . Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal 
champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, 
and bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an 
unparalleled mastery with w eapons and armor, and a 
thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they 
are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and 
staring it defiantly in the face.
W e l l - R o u n d e d  S p e c i a l i s t s
Fighters learn the basics of all com bat styles. Every 
fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a 
longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes 
in a net with som e degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is 
adept with shields and every form  of armor. Beyond that 
basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a 
certain style of combat. Som e concentrate on archery, 
som e on fighting with two w eapons at once, and som e 
on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This 
combination of broad general ability and extensive 
specialization makes fighters superior combatants 
on battlefields and in dungeons alike.
T r a i n e d  f o r  D a n g e r  
Not every m em ber of the city watch, the village militia, 
or the queen’s army is a fighter. Most of these troops are 
relatively untrained soldiers with only the most basic 
com bat knowledge. Veteran soldiers, military officers, 
trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar 
figures are fighters.
Som e fighters feel drawn to use their training as 
adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and 
other dangerous work com m on am ong adventurers is 
second nature for a fighter, not all that different from 
the life he or she left behind. There are greater risks, 
perhaps, but also much greater rewards—few fighters in 
the city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic 
flame tongue sword, for example.
C r e a t i n g  a  F i g h t e r
As you build your fighter, think about two related 
elements of your character's background: W here did 
you get your combat training, and what set you apart 
from the mundane warriors around you? W ere you 
particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a 
mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication? 
What drove you to this training in the first place? A 
threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need 
to prove yourself might all have been factors.
You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble’s 
army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war 
academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. 
Or you might be self-taught—unpolished but well tested. 
Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits 
of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family 
tradition? W here did you acquire your w eapons and 
armor? They might have been military issue or family 
heirlooms, or perhaps you scrim ped and saved for years
to buy them. Your armaments are now am ong your 
m ost important possessions—the only things that stand 
between you and death’s embrace.
Q u i c k  B u i l d
You can make a fighter quickly by following these 
suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your 
highest ability score, depending on whether you 
want to focus on melee w eapons or on archery (or 
finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be 
Constitution, or Intelligence if you plan to adopt the 
Eldritch Knight martial archetype. Second, choose 
the soldier background.

F i g h t i n g  S t y l e
You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. 
Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a 
Fighting Style option m ore than once, even if you later 
get to choose again.
A r c h e r y
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with 
ranged weapons.
D e f e n s e
W hile you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
D u e l i n g
W hen you are wielding a m elee weapon in one hand and 
no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls 
with that weapon.
G r e a t  W e a p o n  F i g h t i n g
W hen you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you 
m ake with a m elee weapon that you are wielding with 
two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new 
roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must 
have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain 
this benefit.
P r o t e c t i o n
W hen a creature you can see attacks a target other 
than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your 
reaction to im pose disadvantage on the attack roll. You 
must be wielding a shield.
T w o -W e a p o n  F i g h t i n g
W hen you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add 
your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.
S e c o n d  W i n d
You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on 
to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use 
a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d 10 + your 
fighter level.
Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or 
long rest before you can use it again.
A c t i o n  S u r g e
Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your 
normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take 
one additional action on top of your regular action and a 
possible bonus action.
Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or 
long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th 
level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on 
the sam e turn.
M a r t i a l  A r c h e t y p e
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to 
emulate in your combat styles and techniques. Choose 
Champion, Battle Master, or Eldritch Knight, all detailed 
at the end of the class description. The archetype you 
choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 
10th, 15th, and 18th level.
A b i l i t y  S c o r e  I m p r o v e m e n t
W hen you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 
14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability 
score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability 
scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase 
an ability score above 20 using this feature.
E x t r a  A t t a c k  
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of 
once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
The number of attacks increases to three when you 
reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach 
20th level in this class.
I n d o m i t a b l e  
Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that 
you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you 
can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.
You can use this feature twice between long rests 
starting at 13th level and three times between long rests 
starting at 17th level.
M a r t i a l  A r c h e t y p e s
Different fighters choose different approaches to 
perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial archetype 
you choose to emulate reflects your approach.
C h a m p i o n  
The archetypal Champion focuses on the development 
of raw physical power honed to deadly perfection.
Those who model themselves on this archetype combine 
rigorous training with physical excellence to deal 
devastating blows.
I m p r o v e d  C r i t i c a l
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd 
level, your w eapon attacks score a critical hit on a 
roll of 19 or 20.
R e m a r k a b l e  A t h l e t e
Starting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency 
bonus (round up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or 
Constitution check you make that doesn’t already use 
your proficiency bonus.
In addition, when you make a running long jump, the 
distance you can cover increases by a number of feet 
equal to your Strength modifier.
A d d i t i o n a l  F i g h t i n g  St y l e
At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the
Fighting Style class feature.
S u r v i v o r
At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in 
battle. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit 
points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you 
have no m ore than half of your hit points left. You don’t 
gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.
B a t t l e  M a s t e r
Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master 
employ martial techniques passed down through 
generations. To a Battle Master, com bat is an academ ic 
field, som etim es including subjects beyond battle such 
as weaponsm ithing and calligraphy. Not every fighter 
absorbs the lessons of history, theory, and artistry 
that are reflected in the Battle Master archetype, but 
those who do are well-rounded fighters of great skill 
and knowledge.
C o m b a t  S u p e r i o r i t y
W hen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you 
learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called 
superiority dice.
Maneuvers. You learn three maneuvers of your 
choice, which are detailed under “Maneuvers” below. 
Many maneuvers enhance an attack in som e way. You 
can use only one maneuver per attack.
You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice 
at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new 
maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you 
know with a different one.
Superiority Dice. You have four superiority dice, 
which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you 
use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice 
when you finish a short or long rest.
You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one 
m ore at 15th level.
Saving Throws. S om e of your maneuvers require 
your target to make a saving throw to resist the 
maneuver’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated 
as follows:
Maneuver save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)
St u d e n t  o f  W a r
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one type of 
artisan’s tools of your choice.
K n o w  Y o u r  E n e m y
Starting at 7th level, if you spend at least 1 minute 
observing or interacting with another creature outside 
combat, you can learn certain information about its 
capabilities com pared to your own. The DM tells you if 
the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard 
to two of the following characteristics of your choice:
S u p e r i o r  C r i t i c a l
Starting at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a 
critical hit on a roll of 18-20.
•
 Strength score
•
 Dexterity score
•
 Constitution score
•
 Arm or Class
•
 Current hit points
•
 Total class levels (if any)
•
 Fighter class levels (if any)
I m p r o v e d  C o m b a t  Su p e r i o r i t y
At 10th level, your superiority dice turn into d10s. At
18th level, they turn into dl2 s.
R e l e n t l e s s
Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and 
have no superiority dice remaining, you regain 1
 
superiority die.
M a n e u v e r s
The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.
Commander’s Strike. W hen you take the Attack 
action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks 
and use a bonus action to direct one of your com panions 
to strike. W hen you do so, choose a friendly creature 
who can see or hear you and expend one superiority die. 
That creature can immediately use its reaction to make 
one w eapon attack, adding the superiority die to the 
attack’s damage roll.
Disarming Attack. W hen you hit a creature with a 
weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to 
attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item 
o f your choice that it’s holding. You add the superiority 
die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must 
make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops 
the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.
Distracting Strike. W hen you hit a creature with a 
weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to 
distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You 
add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll. The 
next attack roll against the target by an attacker other 
than you has advantage if the attack is made before the 
start of your next turn.
Evasive Footwork. W hen you move, you can expend 
one superiority die, rolling the die and adding the 
number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.
Feinting Attack. You can expend one superiority die 
and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing 
one creature within 5 feet of you as your target. You 
have advantage on your next attack roll against that 
creature. If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the 
attack’s damage roll.
Goading Attack. W hen you hit a creature with a 
weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to 
attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add 
the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and 
the target must make a W isdom  saving throw. On a 
failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack 
rolls against targets other than you until the end of 
your next turn.
Lunging Attack. W hen you make a melee weapon 
attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die 
to increase your reach for that attack by 5 feet. If you hit, 
you add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll.
Maneuvering Attack. W hen you hit a creature with 
a w eapon attack, you can expend one superiority 
die to maneuver one o f your com rades into a more 
advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the 
attack’s damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature 
who can see or hear you. That creature can use its 
reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking 
opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.
Menacing Attack. W hen you hit a creature with a 
weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to 
attempt to frighten the target. You add the superiority 
die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must 
make a W isdom  saving throw. On a failed save, it is 
frightened of you until the end o f your next turn.
Parry. W hen another creature dam ages you with a 
melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one 
superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you 
roll on your superiority die + your Dexterity modifier.
Precision Attack. W hen you make a weapon attack 
roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority 
die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver 
before or after making the attack roll, but before any 
effects of the attack are applied.
Pushing Attack. W hen you hit a creature with 
a w eapon attack, you can expend one superiority 
die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the 
superiority die to the attack's dam age roll, and if the 
target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength 
saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up 
to 15 feet away from you.
Rally. On your turn, you can use a bonus action and 
expend one superiority die to bolster the resolve of one 
o f your com panions. W hen you do so, choose a friendly 
creature w ho can see or hear you. That creature gains 
temporary hit points equal to the superiority die roll + 
your Charisma modifier.
Riposte. W hen a creature m isses you with a melee 
attack, you can use your reaction and expend one 
superiority die to make a melee weapon attack against 
the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the 
attack's damage roll.
Sweeping Attack. W hen you hit a creature with a 
melee weapon attack, you can expend one superiority 
die to attempt to dam age another creature with the 
same attack. C hoose another creature within 5 feet 
of the original target and within your reach. If the 
original attack roll w ould hit the second creature, it 
takes damage equal to the number you roll on your 
superiority die. The damage is of the same type dealt by 
the original attack.
Trip Attack. W hen you hit a creature with a weapon 
attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt 
to knock the target down. You add the superiority die 
to the attack’s damage roll, and if the target is Large or 
smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a 
failed save, you knock the target prone.
E l d r i t c h  K n i g h t
The archetypal Eldritch Knight com bines the martial 
mastery com m on to all fighters with a careful study of 
magic. Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar 
to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study
on two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and 
evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight 
additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal 
damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter’s 
reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively 
small number of spells, com m itting them to m em ory 
instead of keeping them in a spellbook.
S p e l l c a s t i n g
W hen you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial 
prow ess with the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 
for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for 
the w izard spell list.
Cantrips. You learn two cantrips of your choice from 
the w izard spell list. You learn an additional wizard 
cantrip of your choice at 10th level.
Spell Slots. The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table 
shows how many spell slots you have to cast your 
spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these 
spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or 
higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you 
finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell shield and 
have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you 
can cast shield using either slot.
Spells Known of 
1st-Level and Higher. You know 
three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which 
you must choose from the abjuration and evocation 
spells on the wizard spell list.
The Spells Known colum n of the Eldritch Knight 
Spellcasting table show s when you learn m ore wizard 
spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be 
an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must 
be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, 
when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one 
new spell o f 1st or 2nd level.
The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can 
com e from any school of magic.
W henever you gain a level in this class, you can 
replace one of the w izard spells you know with another 
spell o f your choice from  the wizard spell list. The 
new spell must be of a level for which you have spell 
slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, 
unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th, 
or 20th level.
Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting 
ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your 
spells through study and memorization. You use your 
Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting 
ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier 
when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you 
cast and when making an attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
your Intelligence modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + 
your Intelligence modifier
W e a p o n  B o n d
At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical 
bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform 
the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done
during a short rest. The w eapon must be within your 
reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which 
you touch the weapon and forge the bond.
Once you have bonded a w eapon to yourself, you 
can’t be disarmed of that w eapon unless you are 
incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, 
you can sum m on that weapon as a bonus action on your 
turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.
You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can 
sum m on only one at a time with your bonus action.
If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must 
break the bond with one of the other two.
W a r  M a g i c
Beginning at 7th level, when you use your action to 
cast a cantrip, you can make one w eapon attack as a 
bonus action.
E l d r i t c h  St r i k e
At 10th level, you learn how  to make your weapon 
strikes undercut a creature’s resistance to your spells. 
W hen you hit a creature with a w eapon attack, that 
creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw 
it makes against a spell you cast before the end of 
your next turn.
A r c a n e  C h a r g e
At 15th level, you gain the ability to teleport up to 30 
feet to an unoccupied space you can see when you use 
your Action Surge. You can teleport before or after the 
additional action.
I m p r o v e d  W a r  M a g i c
Starting at 18th level, when you use your action to 
cast a spell, you can make one weapon attack as a 
bonus action.

M o n k
Her fists a blur as they deflect an incom ing hail of arrows, 
a half-elf springs over a barricade and throws herself 
into the m assed ranks o f hobgoblins on the other side. 
She whirls am ong them, knocking their blows aside and 
sending them reeling, until at last she stands alone.
Taking a deep breath, a human covered in tattoos 
settles into a battle stance. As the first charging orc s 
reach him, he exhales and a blast o f fire roars from  his 
mouth, engulfing his foes.
Moving with the silence of the night, a black-clad 
halfling steps into a shadow beneath an arch and 
em erges from  another inky shadow on a balcony a 
stone’s throw away. She slides her blade free o f its cloth- 
wrapped scabbard and peers through the open window 
at the tyrant prince, so vulnerable in the grip o f sleep.
Whatever their discipline, m onks are united in their 
ability to magically harness the energy that flows in 
their bodies. W hether channeled as a striking display 
of com bat prowess or a subtler focus o f defensive ability 
and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.
T h e  M a g i c  o f  K i
M onks make careful study o f a magical energy that most 
monastic traditions call ki. This energy is an element 
of the magic that suffuses the multiverse—specifically, 
the element that flows through living bodies. M onks 
harness this power within themselves to create magical 
effects and exceed their bodies' physical capabilities, 
and som e of their special attacks can hinder the flow of 
ki in their opponents. Using this energy, m onks channel 
uncanny speed and strength into their unarm ed strikes. 
As they gain experience, their martial training and their 
mastery of ki gives them m ore power over their bodies 
and the bodies of their foes.
T r a i n i n g  a n d  A s c e t i c i s m
Sm all walled cloisters dot the landscapes o f the worlds 
o f D&D, tiny refuges from  the flow of ordinary life, 
where time seem s to stand still. The m onks w ho live 
there seek personal perfection through contemplation 
and rigorous training. Many entered the monastery 
as children, sent to live there when their parents died, 
when food couldn’t be found to support them, or in 
return for som e kindness that the m onks had perform ed 
for their families.
S om e m onks live entirely apart from the surrounding 
population, secluded from anything that might impede 
their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation,
em erging only to serve as spies or assassins at the 
com m and of their leader, a noble patron, or som e other 
mortal or divine power.
The majority o f m onks don’t shun their neighbors, 
making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and 
exchanging their service for food and other goods. As 
versatile warriors, m onks often end up protecting their 
neighbors from m onsters or tyrants.
For a monk, becom ing an adventurer means leaving 
a structured, com m unal lifestyle to becom e a wanderer. 
This can be a harsh transition, and m onks don’t 
undertake it lightly. Those w ho leave their cloisters take 
their w ork seriously, approaching their adventures as 
personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth.
As a rule, m onks care little for material wealth and are 
driven by a desire to accom plish a greater m ission than 
merely slaying m onsters and plundering their treasure.
C REATING A M O N K
As you make your monk character, think about your 
connection to the monastery where you learned your 
skills and spent your formative years. W ere you an 
orphan or a child left on the monastery’s threshold? Did 
your parents prom ise you to the m onastery in gratitude 
for a service perform ed by the m onks? Did you enter 
this secluded life to hide from a crim e you com m itted? 
Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself?
Consider why you left. Did the head of your monastery 
choose you for a particularly important mission beyond 
the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of 
som e violation of the com m unity’s rules. Did you dread 
leaving, or w ere you happy to go? Is there som ething 
you hope to accom plish outside the monastery? Are you 
eager to return to your home?
A s a result of the structured life o f a m onastic 
community and the discipline required to harness ki, 
m onks are almost always lawful in alignment.
Q u i c k  B u i l d
You can make a m onk quickly by following these 
suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest 
ability score, followed by W isdom . Second, choose the 
hermit background.

Perfect Self
U n a r m o r e d  D e f e n s e
Beginning at 1st level, while you are w earing no armor 
and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your 
Dexterity modifier + your W isdom  modifier.
M a r t i a l  A r t s
At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you 
mastery of combat styles that use unarm ed strikes and 
m onk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple 
melee w eapons that don’t have the two-handed or 
heavy property.
You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed 
or wielding only m onk w eapons and you aren’t wearing 
armor or wielding a shield:
•
 You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the 
attack and damage rolls o f your unarmed strikes and 
m onk weapons.
•
 You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage 
of your unarm ed strike or m onk weapon. This die 
changes as you gain m onk levels, as shown in the 
Martial Arts colum n of the M onk table.
•
 W hen you use the Attack action with an unarmed 
strike or a m onk w eapon on your turn, you can make 
one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if 
you take the Attack action and attack with a quarter- 
staff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus 
action, assum ing you haven't already taken a bonus 
action this turn.
Certain m onasteries use specialized form s of the 
m onk weapons. For example, you might use a club 
that is two lengths of w ood connected by a short chain 
(called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter 
blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a 
m onk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided 
for the weapon in chapter 5.
K i 
Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to 
harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this 
energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your 
m onk level determines the number of points you have, 
as shown in the Ki Points colum n of the M onk table.
You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. 
You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, 
Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn m ore 
ki features as you gain levels in this class.
W hen you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until 
you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you 
draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You 
must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to 
regain your ki points.
Som e of your ki features require your target to make 
a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving 
throw DC is calculated as follows:
Ki save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
your Wisdom modifier
F l u r r y  o f  B l o w s
Immediately after you take the Attack action on your 
turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed 
strikes as a bonus action.
Pa t i e n t  D e f e n s e
You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a 
bonus action on your turn.
St e p  o f  t h e  W i n d
You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash 
action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump 
distance is doubled for the turn.
U n a r m o r e d  M o v e m e n t
Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet 
while you are not w earing armor or wielding a shield. 
This bonus increases when you reach certain monk 
levels, as shown in the M onk table.
At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical 
surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling 
during the move.
M o n a s t i c  T r a d i t i o n
W hen you reach 3rd level, you com m it yourself to a 
monastic tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, the Way 
o f Shadow, or the Way o f the Four Elements, all detailed 
at the end of the class description. Your tradition 
grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, 
and 17th level.
D e f l e c t  M i s s i l e s  
Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to 
deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged 
weapon attack. W hen you do so, the damage you take 
from the attack is reduced by 1d 10 + your Dexterity 
modifier + your m onk level.
If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the 
missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand 
and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a 
missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a 
ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition 
you just caught, as part of the sam e reaction. You make 
this attack with proficiency, regardless o f your weapon 
proficiencies, and the missile counts as a m onk weapon 
for the attack.
A b i l i t y  S c o r e  I m p r o v e m e n t
W hen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, 
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your 
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of 
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability 
score above 20 using this feature.
S l o w  F a l l
Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when 
you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an 
amount equal to five times your m onk level.
E x t r a  A t t a c k
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of 
once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
S t u n n i n g  S t r i k e
Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of 
ki in an opponent’s body. W hen you hit another creature 
with a melee w eapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to 
attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a 
Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of 
your next turn.
K i - E m p o w e r e d  S t r i k e s
Starting at 6th level, your unarm ed strikes count as 
magical for the purpose of overcom ing resistance and 
immunity to nonm agical attacks and damage.
E v a s i o n
At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge 
out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue 
dragon’s lightning breath or a fireball spell. W hen you 
are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a 
Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you 
instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving 
throw, and only half damage if you fail.
S t i l l n e s s  o f  M i n d
Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one 
effect on yourself that is causing you to be charm ed 
or frightened.
P u r i t y  o f  B o d y
At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you 
makes you immune to disease and poison.
T o n g u e  o f  t h e  S u n  a n d  M o o n
Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other 
minds so that you understand all spoken languages. 
Moreover, any creature that can understand a language 
can understand what you say.
D i a m o n d  S o u l
Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you 
proficiency in all saving throws.
Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and 
fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the 
second result.
During that time, you also have resistance to all damage 
but force damage.
Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the 
astral projection spell, without needing material 
com ponents. W hen you do so, you can’t take any other 
creatures with you.
P e r f e c t  S e l f
At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki 
points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.
M o n a s t i c  T r a d i t i o n s
Three traditions of monastic pursuit are com m on in 
the monasteries scattered across the multiverse. Most 
m onasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a 
few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk 
according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three 
traditions rely on the sam e basic techniques, diverging 
as the student grows m ore adept. Thus, a m onk need 
choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.
W a y  o f  t h e  O p e n  H a n d  
M onks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate 
masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or 
unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their 
opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their 
bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can 
protect them from  harm.
O p e n  H a n d  T e c h n i q u e
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, 
you can manipulate your enemy’s ki when you harness 
your own. W henever you hit a creature with one of the 
attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can im pose 
one of the following effects on that target:
•
 It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be 
knocked prone.
•
 It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you 
can push it up to 15 feet away from  you.
•
 It can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn.
W h o l e n e s s  o f  B o d y
At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an 
action, you can regain hit points equal to three times
T i m e l e s s  B o d y  
At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer 
none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged 
magically. You can still die of old age, however. In 
addition, you no longer need food or water.
E m p t y  B o d y
Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to 
spend 4 ki points to becom e invisible for 1 minute.
your m onk level. You must finish a long rest before you 
can use this feature again.
T r a n q u i l i t y
Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special 
meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At 
the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a sanctuary 
spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the 
spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC 
for the spell equals 8 + your W isdom  modifier + your 
proficiency bonus.
Q u i v e r i n g  Pa l m
At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal 
vibrations in som eone’s body. W hen you hit a creature 
with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to 
start these im perceptible vibrations, which last for a 
number of days equal to your m onk level. The vibrations 
are harm less unless you use your action to end them.
To do so, you and the target must be on the sam e plane 
of existence. W hen you use this action, the creature 
must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is 
reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d 10 
necrotic damage.
You can have only one creature under the effect of this 
feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations 
harmlessly without using an action.
W a y  o f  S h a d o w  
Monks of the Way of Shadow  follow a tradition that 
values stealth and subterfuge. These m onks might 
be called ninjas or shadowdancers, and they serve as 
spies and assassins. Som etim es the m em bers of a 
ninja monastery are family mem bers, form ing a clan 
sworn to secrecy about their arts and missions. Other 
m onasteries are m ore like thieves’ guilds, hiring out 
their services to nobles, rich merchants, or anyone else 
who can pay their fees. Regardless of their methods, the 
heads of these m onasteries expect the unquestioning 
obedience of their students.
S h a d o w  A r t s
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you 
can use your ki to duplicate the effects of certain spells. 
As an action, you can spend 2 ki points to cast darkness, 
darkvision, pass without trace, or silence, without 
providing material com ponents. Additionally, you gain 
the minor illusion cantrip if you don’t already know it.
S h a d o w  St e p
At 6th level, you gain the ability to step from one shadow 
into another. W hen you are in dim light or darkness, 
as a bonus action you can teleport up to 60 feet to an 
unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light 
or darkness. You then have advantage on the first melee 
attack you make before the end of the turn.
C l o a k  o f  S h a d o w s
By 11th level, you have learned to becom e one with 
the shadows. W hen you are in an area of dim light or 
darkness, you can use your action to becom e invisible. 
You remain invisible until you make an attack, cast a 
spell, or are in an area of bright light.
O p p o r t u n i s t
At 17th level, you can exploit a creature's momentary 
distraction when it is hit by an attack. W henever a 
creature within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack made by 
a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to 
make a melee attack against that creature.
W a y  o f  t h e  F o u r  E l e m e n t s
You follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to 
harness the elements. W hen you focus your ki, you can 
align yourself with the forces of creation and bend the 
four elements to your will, using them as an extension 
of your body. Som e m em bers of this tradition dedicate 
themselves to a single element, but others weave the 
elements together.
Many m onks of this tradition tattoo their bodies with 
representations of their ki powers, com m only imagined 
as coiling dragons, but also as phoenixes, fish, plants, 
mountains, and cresting waves.
D i s c i p l e  o f  t h e  E l e m e n t s  
W hen you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn 
magical disciplines that harness the power of the four 
elements. A discipline requires you to spend ki points 
each time you use it.
You know the Elemental Attunement discipline and 
one other elemental discipline of your choice, which are 
detailed in the “Elemental Disciplines” section below. 
You learn one additional elemental discipline of your 
choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.
W henever you learn a new elemental discipline, 
you can also replace one elemental discipline that you 
already know with a different discipline.
Casting Elemental Spells. Som e elemental 
disciplines allow you to cast spells. S ee chapter 10 for 
the general rules of spellcasting. To cast one o f these 
spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you 
don’t need to provide material com ponents for it.
Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend 
additional ki points to increase the level of an elemental 
discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has 
an enhanced effect at a higher level, as burning hands 
does. The spell's level increases by 1 for each additional 
ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level 
m onk and use Sweeping Cinder Strike to cast burning 
hands, you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level 
spell (the discipline’s base cost of 2 ki points plus 1).
The maximum num ber of ki points you can spend to 
cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost 
and any additional ki points you spend to increase its 
level) is determined by your m onk level, as shown in the 
Spells and Ki Points table.

M o n a s t i c  O r d e r s
The worlds of D&D contain a multitude of monasteries 
and monastic traditions. In
 lands with an Asian cultural 
flavor, such as Shou Lung far to the east of the Forgotten 
Realms, these monasteries are associated with philosophical 
traditions and martial arts practice. The Iron Hand School, 
the Five Stars School, the Northern Fist School, and 
the Southern Star School of Shou Lung teach different 
approaches to the physical, mental, and spiritual disciplines 
of 
the monk. Some of 
these monasteries have spread to the 
western lands of Faerun, particularly in places with large 
Shou immigrant communities, such as Thesk and Westgate.
Other monastic traditions are associated with deities who 
teach the value of physical excellence and mental discipline.
In the Forgotten Realms, the order of the Dark Moon is 
made up of monks dedicated to Shar (goddess of loss), who 
maintain secret communities in remote hills, back allies, 
and subterranean hideaways. Monasteries of Ilmater (god 
of endurance) are named after flowers, and their orders 
carry the names of great heroes of 
the faith; the Disciples of 
Saint Sollars the Twice-Martyred reside in the Monastery of 
the Yellow Rose near Damara. The monasteries of Eberron 
combine the study of martial arts with a life of scholarship. 
Most are devoted to the deities of the Sovereign Host.
In the world of Dragonlance, most monks are devoted to 
Majere, god of meditation and thought. In
 Greyhawk, many 
monasteries are dedicated to Xan Yae, the goddess of 
twilight 
and the superiority of mind over matter, or to Zuoken, god of 
mental and physical mastery.
The evil monks of the Scarlet Brotherhood in the world of 
Greyhawk derive their fanatic zeal not from devotion to a god 
but from dedication to the principles of 
their nation and their 
race— the belief 
that the Suel strand of humanity are meant 
to rule the world.
Pa l a d i n  
Clad in plate armor that gleam s in the sunlight despite 
the dust and grime of long travel, a human lays down 
her sword and shield and places her hands on a mortally 
wounded man. Divine radiance shines from her hands, 
the man’s wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide 
with amazement.
A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak 
making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches 
an orc war band celebrating its recent victory. Silently, 
he stalks into their midst and w hispers an oath, and two 
ores are dead before they even realize he is there.
Silver hair shining in a shaft o f light that seem s to 
illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation. His 
spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again 
at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcom es its 
hideous darkness.
Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are 
united by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil. 
W hether sworn before a god’s altar and the witness of 
a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey 
beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the 
dead as the only witness, a paladin’s oath is a powerful 
bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior 
into a blessed champion.
T h e  C a u s e  o f  R i g h t e o u s n e s s
A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, 
to stand with the good things of the world against the 
encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil 
wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various 
aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are 
bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their 
sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to 
gods of good, a paladin’s power com es as much from  a 
commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.
Paladins train for years to learn the skills o f combat, 
mastering a variety o f w eapons and armor. Even so, 
their martial skills are secondary to the magical power 
they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite 
the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent 
and those who join them in the fight for justice.
B e y o n d  t h e  M u n d a n e  L i f e
Alm ost by definition, the life of a paladin is an 
adventuring life. Unless a lasting injury has taken him 
or her away from adventuring for a time, every paladin 
lives on the front lines of the cosm ic struggle against

evil. Fighters are rare enough am ong the ranks of the 
militias and arm ies of the world, but even fewer people 
can claim the true calling of a paladin. W hen they do 
receive the call, these w arriors turn from their former 
occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Som etim es 
their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as 
leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their 
loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to 
crow n and country.
Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A  
delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest 
driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of 
treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, 
and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the 
cosm ic balance away from  oblivion.
C r e a t i n g  a  P a l a d i n
The m ost important aspect of a paladin character is 
the nature of his or her holy quest. Although the class 
features related to your oath don't appear until you 
reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that choice by reading 
the oath descriptions at the end of the class. Are you a 
devoted servant of good, loyal to the gods of 
justice and 
honor, a holy knight in shining armor venturing forth 
to smite evil? Are you a glorious champion of the light, 
cherishing everything beautiful that stands against the 
shadow, a knight w hose oath descends from traditions 
older than many o f the gods? Or are you an embittered 
loner sworn to take vengeance on those who have done 
great evil, sent as an angel of death by the gods or driven 
by your need for revenge? Appendix B lists many deities 
worshiped by paladins throughout the multiverse, such
as Torm, Tyr, Heironeous,
Paladine, Kiri-Jolith, Dol 
Arrah, the Silver Flame,
Bahamut, Athena, Re-Horakhty, 
and Heimdall.
How did you experience your call to 
serve as a paladin? Did you hear a whisper 
from  an unseen god or angel while you were at 
prayer? Did another paladin sense the potential within 
you and decide to train you as a squire? Or did som e 
terrible event—the destruction of your home, perhaps— 
drive you to your quests? Perhaps you stumbled into 
a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found 
yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness 
and beauty. Or you might have known from your earliest 
m em ories that the paladin’s life was your calling, almost 
as if you had been sent into the world with that purpose 
stamped on your soul.
As guardians against the forces of wickedness, 
paladins are rarely of any evil alignment. M ost of them 
walk the paths of charity and justice. Consider how your 
alignment colors the way you pursue your holy quest 
and the manner in which you conduct yourself before 
gods and mortals. Your oath and alignment might be 
in harmony, or your oath might represent standards of 
behavior that you have not yet attained.
Q u i c k  B u i l d
You can make a paladin quickly by following these 
suggestions. First, Strength should be your highest 
ability score, followed by Charisma. Second, choose the 
noble background.
C lass F e a t u r e s

•
 Chain mail and a holy symbol
D i v i n e  S e n s e  
The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like 
a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly 
music in your ears. As an action, you can open your 
awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your 
next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, 
or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total 
cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of 
any being w hose presence you sense, but not its identity 
(the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). 
Within the sam e radius, you also detect the presence 
o f any place or object that has been consecrated or 
desecrated, as with the hallow spell.
You can use this feature a num ber of times equal to
1 + your Charisma modifier. W hen you finish a long rest, 
you regain all expended uses.
L a y  o n  H a n d s
Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool 
of healing power that replenishes when you take a long 
rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of 
hit points equal to your paladin level x 5.
As an action, you can touch a creature and draw 
power from the pool to restore a num ber of hit points 
to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining 
in your pool.
Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your 
pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or 
neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple 
diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single 
use o f Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately 
for each one.
This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.
At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your 
specialty. C hoose one of the following options. You can’t 
take a Fighting Style option m ore than once, even if you 
later get to choose again.
D e f e n s e
W hile you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. 
D u e l i n g
W hen you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and 
no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls 
with that weapon.
G r e a t  W e a p o n  F i g h t i n g
W hen you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you 
make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with 
two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new 
roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile 
property for you to gain this benefit.
P r o t e c t i o n
W hen a creature you can see attacks a target other 
than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your 
reaction to im pose disadvantage on the attack roll.
You must be wielding a shield.
S p e l l c a s t i n g
By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine 
m agic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as 
a cleric does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of 
spellcasting and chapter 11 for the paladin spell list.
P r e p a r i n g  a n d  C a s t i n g  S p e l l s
The Paladin table show s how many spell slots you have 
to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 
1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s 
level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when 
you finish a long rest.
You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available 
for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. 
W hen you do so, choose a number of paladin spells 
equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin 
level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells 
must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have 
four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a 
Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include 
four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you 
prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast 
it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell 
doesn’t remove it from  your list of prepared spells.
You can change your list of prepared spells when you 
finish a long rest. Preparing a new list o f paladin spells 
requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 
minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
S p e l l c a s t i n g  A b i l i t y
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin 
spells, since their pow er derives from  the strength of
your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a 
spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you 
use your Charisma m odifier when setting the saving 
throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making 
an attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
your Charisma modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + 
your Charisma modifier
S p e l l c a s t i n g  F o c u s
You can use a holy sym bol (found in chapter 5) as a 
spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.
D i v i n e  S m i t e
Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a 
melee weapon attack, you can expend one paladin spell 
slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to 
the w eapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 
1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher 
than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases 
by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend.
D i v i n e  H e a l t h
By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you 
m akes you immune to disease.
S a c r e d  O a t h
W hen you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds 
you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been 
in a preparatory stage, com m itted to the path but not 
yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion, 
the Oath of the Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all 
detailed at the end of the class description.
Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again 
at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath 
spells and the Channel Divinity feature.
O a t h  S p e l l s
Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain 
access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath 
description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you 
always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t count against 
the number of spells you can prepare each day.
If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the 
paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin 
spell for you.
C h a n n e l  D i v i n i t y
Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel 
m agical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided 
by your oath explains how to use it.
W hen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose 
which option to use. You must then finish a short or long 
rest to use your Channel Divinity again.
Som e Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. 
W hen you use such an effect from  this class, the DC 
equals your paladin spell save DC.
A b i l i t y  S c o r e  I m p r o v e m e n t
W hen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, 
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your 
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of 
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability 
score above 20 using this feature.
E x t r a  A t t a c k
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of 
once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
A u r a  o f  P r o t e c t i o n
Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature 
within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the 
creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your 
Charisma m odifier (with a minim um bonus of +1). You 
must be conscious to grant this bonus.
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
A u r a  o f  C o u r a g e
Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures 
within 10 feet of you can’t be frightened while you 
are conscious.
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
I m p r o v e d  D i v i n e  S m i t e
By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous 
might that all your melee w eapon strikes carry divine 
power with them. W henever you hit a creature with a 
melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant 
damage. If you also use your Divine Smite with an 
attack, you add this damage to the extra damage o f your 
Divine Smite.
C l e a n s i n g  T o u c h
Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to 
end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature 
that you touch.
You can use this feature a number of times equal 
to your Charisma m odifier (a minimum o f once). You 
regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.
Sa c r e d O a t h s
B ecom ing a paladin involves taking vows that commit 
the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active 
path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken 
when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination 
of all the paladin’s training. Som e characters with this 
class don’t consider themselves true paladins until 
they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For 
others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, 
an official stamp on what has always been true in the 
paladin’s heart.
O a t h  o f  D e v o t i o n
The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest 
ideals of 
justice, virtue, and order. Som etim es called 
cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these 
paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor,
acting with honor in pursuit o f 
justice and the greater 
good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of 
conduct, and som e, for better or w orse, hold the rest of 
the world to the same standards. Many who swear this 
oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their 
gods’ tenets as the measure o f their devotion. They hold 
angels—the perfect servants o f good—as their ideals, 
and incorporate im ages of angelic wings into their 
helmets or coats of arms.
T e n e t s  o f  D e v o t i o n
Though the exact w ords and strictures of the Oath of 
Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.
Honesty. D on’t lie or cheat. Let your word be 
your promise.
Courage. Never fear to act, though caution is wise. 
Compassion. Aid others, protect the weak, and 
punish those who threaten them. Show  m ercy to your 
foes, but temper it with wisdom .
Honor. Treat others with fairness, and let your 
honorable deeds be an example to them. D o as 
much good as possible while causing the least 
amount of harm.
Duty. Be responsible for your actions and their 
consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, 
and obey those w ho have just authority over you.

B r e a k i n g  Y o u r  O a t h
A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, 
but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes 
the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation 
calls for the lesser of 
two evils, and sometimes the heat of 
emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.
A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution 
from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another 
paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all- 
night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a 
fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and 
forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.
If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no 
sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious.
At the DM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be 
forced to abandon this class and adopt another, or perhaps 
to take the Oathbreaker paladin option that appears in the 
Dungeon Master's Guide.
 
reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action 
or try to escape from  an effect that prevents it from 
moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use 
the D odge action.

Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 
10 feet o f you can’t be charm ed while you are conscious. 
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects 
of a protection from evil and good spell.
H o l y  N im b u s
At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of 
sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 
30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that.
Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the 
bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage.
In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on 
saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until 
you finish a long rest.
O a t h  o f  t h e  A n c i e n t s
The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the race of elves 
and the rituals of the druids. Som etim es called fey 
knights, green knights, or horned knights, paladins who 
swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light 
in the cosm ic struggle against darkness because they 
love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world, 
not necessarily because they believe in principles of 
honor, courage, and justice. They adorn their arm or and 
clothing with images of growing things—leaves, antlers, 
or flowers—to reflect their commitment to preserving 
life and light in the world.
T e n e t s  o f  t h e  A n c i e n t s
The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been 
preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath 
emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns 
of law or chaos. Its four central principles are simple.

W hen you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the 
following two Channel Divinity options.
Sacred Weapon. As an action, you can imbue one 
weapon that you are holding with positive energy, 
using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add 
your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that 
weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The w eapon also 
emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 
feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it 
becom es magical for the duration.
You can end this effect on your turn as part of any 
other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying 
this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.
Turn the Unholy. As an action, you present your 
holy sym bol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and 
undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or 
undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you 
must make a W isdom  saving throw. If the creature 
fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until 
it takes damage.
A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move 
as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly 
move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take

that would swallow it. W here life flourishes, stand 
against the forces that would render it barren.
Preserve Your Own Light. Delight in song and 
laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in

shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while 
it is turned.

Beginning at 7th level, ancient magic lies so heavily 
upon you that it forms an eldritch ward. You and friendly 
creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to 
damage from spells.
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
U n d y i n g  S e n t i n e l
Starting at 15th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit 
points and are not killed outright, you can choose to 
drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this ability, you 
can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
Additionally, you suffer none of the drawbacks o f old 
age, and you can’t be aged magically.

At 20th level, you can assume the form of an ancient 
force of nature, taking on an appearance you choose.
For example, your skin might turn green or take on a 
bark-like texture, your hair might becom e leafy or m oss- 
like, or you might sprout antlers or a lion-like mane.
Using your action, you undergo a transformation.
For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:
•
 At the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 hit 
points.
•
 W henever you cast a paladin spell that has a casting 
time of 1 action, you can cast it using a bonus action 
instead.
•
 Enemy creatures within 10 feet of you have disadvan­
tage on saving throws against your paladin spells and 
Channel Divinity options.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until 
you finish a long rest.
O a t h  o f  V e n g e a n c e
The Oath of Vengeance is a solem n commitment to 
punish those who have com m itted a grievous sin. W hen 
evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire 
people turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves’ 
guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon 
rampages through the countryside—at times like these, 
paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set 
right that which has gone wrong. To these paladins— 
som etim es called avengers or dark knights—their own 
purity is not as important as delivering justice.

W hen you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the

Nature’s Wrath. You can use your Channel Divinity 
to invoke primeval forces to ensnare a foe. As an action, 
you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach 
for a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see.
The creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity 
saving throw (its choice) or be restrained. W hile 
restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving 
throw at the end o f each of its turns. On a success, it 
frees itself and the vines vanish.
Turn the Faithless. You can use your Channel 
Divinity to utter ancient w ords that are painful for fey 
and fiends to hear. As an action, you present your holy
T e n e t s  o f  V e n g e a n c e
The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but 
all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by 
any means necessary. Paladins w ho uphold these tenets 
are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to 
mete out justice upon those w ho do evil, so the paladins 
are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The 
core principles of the tenets are brutally simple.
Fight the Greater Evil. Faced with a choice of fighting 
my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil. I choose the 
greater evil.
No Mercy 
for the Wicked. Ordinary foes might win 
my mercy, but my sworn enem ies do not.
By 
Any Means Necessary. My qualms can’t get in the 
way of exterminating my foes.
Restitution. If my foes w reak ruin on the world, it is 
because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed 
by their m isdeeds.

C h a n n e l  D i v i n i t y
W hen you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the 
following two Channel Divinity options.
Abjure Enemy. As an action, you present your holy 
symbol and speak a prayer of denunciation, using your 
Channel Divinity. C hoose one creature within 60 feet 
of you that you can see. That creature must make a 
W isdom  saving throw, unless it is immune to being 
frightened. Fiends and undead have disadvantage on 
this saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 
minute or until it takes any damage. W hile frightened, 
the creature’s speed is 0, and it can’t benefit from any 
bonus to its speed.
On a successful save, the creature’s speed is halved 
for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.
Vow o f 
Enmity. As a bonus action, you can utter a vow 
of enmity against a creature you can see within 10 feet 
of you, using your Channel Divinity. You gain advantage 
on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until 
it drops to 0 hit points or falls unconscious.
R e l e n t l e s s  A v e n g e r
By 7th level, your supernatural focus helps you close 
off a foe’s retreat. W hen you hit a creature with an 
opportunity attack, you can move up to half your 
speed immediately after the attack and as part of 
the same reaction. This movement doesn’t provoke 
opportunity attacks.
S o u l  o f  V e n g e a n c e
Starting at 15th level, the authority with which you 
speak your Vow of Enmity gives you greater power over 
your foe. W hen a creature under the effect o f your Vow 
of Enmity m akes an attack, you can use your reaction to 
make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is 
within range.
A v e n g i n g  A n g e l
At 20th level, you can assume the form of an 
angelic avenger. Using your action, you undergo a 
transformation. For 1 hour, you gain the following 
benefits:
•
 W ings sprout from  your back and grant you a flying 
speed of 60 feet.
•
 You emanate an aura of m enace in a 30-foot radius. 
The first time any enemy creature enters the aura or 
starts its turn there during a battle, the creature must 
succeed on a W isdom  saving throw or becom e fright­
ened of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. 
Attack rolls against the frightened creature have 
advantage.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until 
you finish a long rest.

Rough and wild looking, 
a human stalks alone 
through the shadows of 
trees, hunting the ores he 
knows are planning a raid 
on a nearby farm. Clutching 
a shortsword in each hand, 
he becom es a whirlwind of 
steel, cutting down one enemy 
after another.
After tumbling away from  a cone of 
freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws 
back her bow  to loose an arrow at the white 
dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates 
from  the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends 
one arrow after another to find the gaps between the 
dragon’s thick scales.
Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk 
that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his 
side. W hispering instructions in Elvish, he points to 
the owlbear he’s been tracking and sends the hawk to 
distract the creature while he readies his bow.
Far from  the bustle of cities and towns, past the 
hedges that shelter the most distant farms from  the 
terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of 
trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, 
rangers keep their unending watch.
D e a d l y  H u n t e r s  
W arriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in 
hunting the m onsters that threaten the edges of 
civilization—humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and 
monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They 
learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving 
stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in 
brush and rubble. Rangers focus their com bat training 
on techniques that are particularly useful against their 
specific favored foes.
Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers 
acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature’s 
power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their 
com bat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. 
A ranger’s talents and abilities are honed with deadly 
focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.
I n d e p e n d e n t  A d v e n t u r e r s
Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a 
guide, or a tracker, a ranger’s true calling is to defend 
the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters 
and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild. In 
som e places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join 
forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are 
independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a 
dragon or a band of orc s attacks, a ranger might be the 
first—and possibly the last—line o f defense.
This fierce independence makes rangers well suited 
to adventuring, since they are accustom ed to life far 
from the com forts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced 
with city-bred adventurers w ho grouse and whine about 
the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with som e

But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can 
carry their own weight in a fight against civilization’s 
foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might 
not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in 
the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.
C r e a t in g  a  R a n g e r
As you create your ranger character, consider the nature 
of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. 
Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds 
together until you mastered the ranger’s ways? Did you 
leave your apprenticeship, or w as your mentor slain— 
perhaps by the same kind of monster that becam e your 
favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as 
part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, 
trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You 
might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat 
skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature 
through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.
W hat’s the source of your particular hatred of a 
certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill som eone 
you loved or destroy your hom e village? Or did you see 
too much of the destruction these monsters cause and 
com m it yourself to reining in their depredations? Is 
your adventuring career a continuation of your work 
in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change?
W hat made you join up with a band of adventurers?
D o you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways 
of the wild, or do you w elcom e the relief from solitude 
that they offer?
Q u i c k  B u i l d
You can make a ranger quickly by following these 
suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability 
score, followed by W isdom . (Som e rangers who focus 
on two-weapon fighting make Strength higher than 
Dexterity.) Second, choose the outlander background.
C lass F e a t u r e s
As a ranger, you gain the following class features.
H i t  P o i n t s
Hit Dice: 1d 10 per ranger level

E q u i p m e n t
You start with the following equipment, in addition to 
the equipment granted by your background:
You are particularly familiar with one type of natural 
environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in 
such regions. C hoose one type of favored terrain: arctic, 
coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, 
or the Underdark. W hen you make an Intelligence or 
W isdom  check related to your favored terrain, your 
proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that 
you’re proficient in.
W hile traveling for an hour or m ore in your favored 
terrain, you gain the following benefits:
•
 Difficult terrain doesn’t slow  your group’s travel.
•
 Your group can’t becom e lost except by magical 
means.
•
 Even when you are engaged in another activity while 
traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), 
you remain alert to danger.
•
 If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at 
a normal pace.
•
 W hen you forage, you find twice as much food as you 
normally would.
•
 W hile tracking other creatures, you also learn their 
exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they 
passed through the area.
You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th 
and 10th level.
F i g h t i n g  S t y l e
At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as 
your specialty. C hoose one of the following options. 
You can’t take a Fighting Style option m ore than once, 
even if you later get to choose again.

W hen you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add 
your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.
S p e l l c a s t i n g  
By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to 
use the m agical essence of nature to cast spells, much 
as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of 
spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.
S p e l l  S l o t s
The Ranger table show s how many spell slots you have 
to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of 
these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level 
or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you 
finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal 
friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot 
available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.
S p e l l s  K n o w n  o f  1s t  L e v e l  a n d  H i g h e r
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the

 (a) two shortswords or (b) two simple melee weapons
•
 (a) a dungeoneer’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack

 A longbow  and a quiver of 20 arrows
F a v o r e d  E n e m y
Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience 
studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain 
type of enemy.
C hoose a type o f favored enemy: aberrations, 
beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, 
fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. 
Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid 
(such as gnolls and orc s) as favored enemies.
You have advantage on W isdom  (Survival) checks to 
track your favored enemies, as w ell as on Intelligence 
checks to recall information about them.
W hen you gain this feature, you also learn one 
language of your choice that is spoken by your favored 
enemies, if they speak one at all.
You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as 
an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you 
gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of 
monsters you have encountered on your adventures.
N a t u r a l  E x p l o r e r
spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this 
class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, 
you can choose one of the ranger spells you know 
and replace it with another spell from the ranger 
spell list, which also must be of a level for which you 
have spell slots.
S p e l l c a s t i n g  A b i l i t y
W isdom  is your spellcasting ability for your ranger 
spells, since your m agic draws on your attunement to 
nature. You use your W isdom  whenever a spell refers 
to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your 
W isdom  modifier when setting the saving throw DC for 
a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll 
with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
your Wisdom modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + 
your Wisdom modifier
R a n g e r  A r c h e t y p e
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive 
to emulate: Hunter or Beast Master, both detailed at 
the end of the class description. Your choice grants 
you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, 
and 15th level.
P r i m e v a l  A w a r e n e s s
Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and 
expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on 
the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell 
slot you expend, you can sense whether the following 
types of creatures are present within 1
 mile of you (or 
within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): 
aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, 
and undead. This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’ 
location or number.
A b i l i t y  S c o r e  I m p r o v e m e n t
W hen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, 
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your 
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of 
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability 
score above 20 using this feature.
E x t r a  A t t a c k
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of 
once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
L a n d ’s S t r i d e
Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical 
difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can 
also pass through nonm agical plants without being 
slowed by them and without taking damage from them if 
they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.
In addition, you have advantage on saving throws 
against plants that are magically created or manipulated 
to im pede movement, such those created by the 
entangle spell.
H i d e  i n  P l a i n  S i g h t  
Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating 
camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh 
mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring 
materials with which to create your camouflage.
Once you are cam ouflaged in this way, you can try 
to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, 
such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide 
as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) 
checks as long as you remain there without moving or 
taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a 
reaction, you must cam ouflage yourself again to gain 
this benefit.
V a n i s h
Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a 
bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by 
nonm agical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.
F e r a l  S e n s e s
At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help 
you fight creatures you can’t see. W hen you attack a 
creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t 
im pose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.
You are also aware of the location of any invisible 
creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the 
creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t 
blinded or deafened.
F o e  S l a y e r
At 20th level, you becom e an unparalleled hunter of your 
enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your 
W isdom  modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of 
an attack you make against one o f your favored enemies. 
You can choose to use this feature before or after the 
roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.
R a n g e r  A r c h e t y p e s
The ideal o f the ranger has two classic expressions: the 
Hunter and the Beast Master.
H u n t e r
Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your 
place as a bulwark between civilization and the terrors 
of the wilderness. As you walk the Hunter’s path, you 
learn specialized techniques for fighting the threats 
you face, from  rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to 
towering giants and terrifying dragons.
H u n t e r ’s P r e y
At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features 
of your choice.
Colossus Slayer. Your tenacity can w ear down 
the most potent foes. W hen you hit a creature with a 
weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage 
if it’s below  its hit point maximum. You can deal this 
extra damage only once per turn.
Giant Killer. W hen a Large or larger creature within
5 feet of you hits or m isses you with an attack, you can 
use your reaction to attack that creature immediately 
after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.
Horde Breaker. Once on each o f your turns when you 
make a weapon attack, you can make another attack 
with the same weapon against a different creature that 
is within 5 feet of the original target and within range 
of your weapon.
D e f e n s i v e  T a c t i c s
At 7th level, you gain one of the following features 
o f your choice.
Escape the Horde. Opportunity attacks against you 
are made with disadvantage.
Multiattack Defense. W hen a creature hits you 
with an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC against 
all subsequent attacks made by that creature for the 
rest of the turn.
Steel Will. You have advantage on saving throws 
against being frightened.
M u l t i a t t a c k
At 11th level, you gain one of the following features 
of your choice.
Volley. You can use your action to make a ranged 
attack against any num ber of creatures within 10 feet 
o f a point you can see within your w eapon’s range. You 
must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and 
you make a separate attack roll for each target.
Whirlwind Attack. You can use your action to make a 
melee attack against any number o f creatures within 5 
feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target.
Su p e r i o r  H u n t e r ’s D e f e n s e
At 15th level, you gain one of the following features 
o f your choice.
Evasion. You can nimbly dodge out of the way of 
certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath 
or a lightning bolt spell. W hen you are subjected to an 
effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw 
to take only half damage, you instead take no damage
if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half 
damage if you fail.
Stand Against the Tide. W hen a hostile creature 
m isses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction 
to force that creature to repeat the sam e attack against 
another creature (other than itself) of your choice.
Uncanny Dodge. W hen an attacker that you can see 
hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to 
halve the attack’s damage against you.
B e a s t  M a s t e r
The Beast Master archetype em bodies a friendship 
between the civilized races and the beasts of the world. 
United in focus, beast and ranger w ork as one to fight 
the monstrous foes that threaten civilization and the 
wilderness alike. Emulating the Beast Master archetype 
means committing yourself to this ideal, working in 
partnership with an animal as its com panion and friend.
R a n g e r ’s C o m p a n i o n
At 3rd level, you gain a beast com panion that 
accom panies you on your adventures and is trained to 
fight alongside you. Choose a beast that is no larger than 
Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower 
(appendix D presents statistics for the hawk, mastiff, 
and panther as examples). Add your proficiency bonus 
to the beast’s AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well 
as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its 
hit point maximum equals its norm al maximum or four 
times your ranger level, whichever is higher.
The beast obeys your com m ands as best as it can. It 
takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn’t take an 
action unless you com m and it to. On your turn, you can 
verbally com m and the beast where to move (no action 
required by you). You can use your action to verbally 
com m and it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, 
or Help action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, 
you can make one weapon attack yourself when you 
com m and the beast to take the Attack action.
W hile traveling through your favored terrain with only 
the beast, you can move stealthily at a norm al pace.
If the beast dies, you can obtain another one by 
spending 8 hours magically bonding with another beast 
that isn’t hostile to you, either the sam e type of beast as 
before or a different one.
E x c e p t i o n a l  T r a i n i n g
Beginning at 7th level, on any of your turns when 
your beast com panion doesn’t attack, you can use a 
bonus action to com m and the beast to take the Dash, 
Disengage, Dodge, or Help action on its turn.
B e s t i a l  F u r y
Starting at 11th level, your beast com panion can 
make two attacks when you com m and it to use the 
Attack action.
S h a r e  S p e l l s
Beginning at 15th level, when you cast a spell targeting 
yourself, you can also affect your beast com panion with 
the spell if the beast is within 30 feet of you.
Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of 
a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat 
abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other 
characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and 
deception, while others refine the skills that help them 
in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and 
disarming traps, and opening locks.
W hen it com es to combat, rogues prioritize cunning 
over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one 
precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will 
hurt the target most, than w ear an opponent down 
with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost 
supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn 
magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.
A  S h a d y  L i v i n g
Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of 
them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, 
making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and 
con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized 
into thieves’ guilds or crim e families. Plenty of rogues 
operate independently, but even they som etim es 
recruit apprentices to help them in their scam s 
and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as
R o g u e
S k i l l  a n d  P r e c i s i o n
Signaling for her com panions to wait, a halfling creeps 
forward through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear 
to the door, then pulls out a set of tools and picks the 
lock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into 
the shadows as her fighter friend m oves forward to kick 
the door open.
A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his 
accom plice prepares for her part in the ambush. When 
their target—a notorious slaver—passes the alleyway, 
the accom plice cries out, the slaver com es to investigate, 
and the assassin’s blade cuts his throat before he can 
make a sound.
Suppressing a giggle, a gnom e waggles her fingers 
and magically lifts the key ring from the guard’s belt.
In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is 
open, and she and her com panions are free to make 
their escape.
Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes’ 
vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. 
They have a knack for finding the solution to just about 
any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and 
versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful 
adventuring party.
locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can 
be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats—and 
wererats—haunt the sewers.
As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. 
S om e are hardened crim inals w ho decide to seek 
their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up 
a life of adventure to escape from the law. Som e have 
learned and perfected their skills with the explicit 
purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts 
in search of treasure.
C r e a t i n g  a  R o g u e  
As you create your rogue character, consider the 
character’s relationship to the law. Do you have a 
criminal past—or present? Are you on the run from  the 
law or from an angry thieves’ guild master? Or did you 
leave your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger 
rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, 
or som e other desire or ideal?
What w as the trigger that led you away from your 
previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly 
w rong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe 
you w ere lucky and a successful robbery gave you the 
coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life.
Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? 
Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your 
family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means 
of support. Or maybe you made a new friend—another 
m em ber of your adventuring party—who showed you 
new possibilities for earning a living and employing 
your particular talents.

Q u i c k  B u i l d
You can make a rogue quickly by following 
these suggestions. First. Dexterity should 
be your highest ability score. Make 
Intelligence your next-highest if you want to 
excel at Investigation or plan to take up the 
Arcane Trickster archetype. C hoose Charisma 
instead if you plan to emphasize deception and social 
interaction. Second, choose the charlatan background.
C lass F e a t u r e s
As a rogue, you have the following class features.
H i t  P o i n t s
Hit Dice: 1d8 per rogue level
Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier 
Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your 
Constitution modifier per rogue level after 1st
P r o f i c i e n c i e s
Armor: Light armor
Weapons: Simple weapons, hand crossbow s, 
longswords, rapiers, shortswords 
Tools: Thieves’ tools
Saving Throws: Dexterity. Intelligence 
Skills: Choose four from Acrobatics, Athletics, 
Deception. Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, 
Perception, Perform ance. Persuasion, Sleight of 
Hand, and Stealth
E q u i p m e n t
You start with the following equipment, in addition to 
the equipment granted by your background:
•
 (a) a rapier or (b) a shortsword
•
 (a) a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or (b) a 
shortsword
•
 (a) a burglar’s pack, (b) a dungeoneer’s pack, or (c) an 
explorer’s pack
•
 Leather armor, two daggers, and thieves’ tools
E x p e r t i s e  
At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or 
one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with 
thieves’ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any 
ability check you make that uses either of the chosen 
proficiencies.
At 6th level, you can choose two m ore of your 
proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain 
this benefit.
S n e a k  A t t a c k
Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly 
and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can 
deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with 
an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The 
attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.
You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another 
enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy 
isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on 
the attack roll.
The amount of the extra damage increases as you 
gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack 
colum n of the Rogue table.
T h i e v e s ’ C a n t
During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a 
secret m ix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to 
hide m essages in seem ingly normal conversation. Only 
another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands 
such m essages. It takes four times longer to convey such 
a m essage than it does to speak the sam e idea plainly.
In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and 
sym bols used to convey short, simple m essages, such 
as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a 
thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the
people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe 
house for thieves on the run.
C u n n i n g  A c t i o n
Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility 
allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a 
bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This 
action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, 
or Hide action.
R o g u i s h  A r c h e t y p e
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate 
in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin, 
or Arcane Trickster, all detailed at the end of the class 
description. Your archetype choice grants you features 
at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.
A b i l i t y  S c o r e  I m p r o v e m e n t
W hen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 
16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score 
of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability 
scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase 
an ability score above 20 using this feature.
U n c a n n y  D o d g e
Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see 
hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to 
halve the attack’s damage against you.
E v a s i o n
Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out o f the 
way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery 
breath or an ice storm spell. W hen you are subjected 
to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving 
throw to take only half damage, you instead take no 
damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only 
half damage if you fail.
R e l i a b l e  T a l e n t
By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until 
they approach perfection. W henever you make an ability 
check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can 
treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
B l i n d s e n s e  
Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are 
aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature 
within 10 feet of you.
S l i p p e r y  M i n d
By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental 
strength. You gain proficiency in W isdom  saving throws.
E l u s i v e
Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that 
attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No 
attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t 
incapacitated.
S t r o k e  o f  L u c k
At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding 
when you need to. If your attack m isses a target within 
range, you can turn the m iss into a hit. Alternatively, if 
you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until 
you finish a short or long rest.
R o g u is h  A r c h e t y p e s
R ogues have many features in com m on, including their 
emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and 
deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick 
reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in 
varying directions, em bodied by the rogue archetypes. 
Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus— 
not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, 
but a description of your preferred techniques.
T h i e f
You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, 
bandits, cutpurses, and other crim inals typically follow 
this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of 
themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, 
delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your 
agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into 
ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using 
magic items you normally couldn’t employ.
Fa s t  H a n d s
Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action 
granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity 
(Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves’ tools to 
disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an 
Object action.
S e c o n d - S t o r y  W o r k
W hen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain 
the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no 
longer costs you extra movement.
In addition, when you make a running jump, the 
distance you cover increases by a num ber of feet equal 
to your Dexterity modifier.
Su p r e m e  S n e a k
Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity 
(Stealth) check if you move no m ore than half your 
speed on the same turn.
U se M a g i c  D e v i c e
By 13th level, you have learned enough about the 
workings of magic that you can improvise the use of 
items even when they are not intended for you. You 
ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use 
of magic items.
T h i e f ’s R e f l e x e s
W hen you reach 17th level, you have becom e adept at 
laying am bushes and quickly escaping danger. You can 
take two turns during the first round of any combat. You 
take your first turn at your normal initiative and your
second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t use 
this feature when you are surprised.
A s s a s s i n
You focus your training on the grim art of death. Those 
who adhere to this archetype are diverse: hired killers, 
spies, bounty hunters, and even specially anointed 
priests trained to exterminate the enem ies of their deity. 
Stealth, poison, and disguise help you eliminate your 
foes with deadly efficiency.
B o n u s  P r o f i c i e n c i e s
W hen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain 
proficiency with the disguise kit and the poisoner’s kit.
A s s a s s i n a t e
Starting at 3rd level, you are at your deadliest when you 
get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on 
attack rolls against any creature that hasn’t taken a turn 
in the com bat yet. In addition, any hit you score against 
a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.
I n f i l t r a t i o n  E x p e r t i s e
Starting at 9th level, you can unfailingly create false 
identities for yourself. You must spend seven days and 
25 gp to establish the history, profession, and affiliations 
for an identity. You can’t establish an identity that 
belongs to som eone else. For example, you might acquire 
appropriate clothing, letters of introduction, and official- 
looking certification to establish yourself as a mem ber of 
a trading house from a remote city so you can insinuate 
yourself into the company of other wealthy merchants.
Thereafter, if you adopt the new identity as a disguise, 
other creatures believe you to be that person until given 
an obvious reason not to.
I m p o s t o r
At 13th level, you gain the ability to unerringly m imic 
another person’s speech, writing, and behavior.
You must spend at least three hours studying 
these three com ponents of the person’s behavior, 
listening to speech, examining handwriting, and 
observing mannerisms.
Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a 
wary creature suspects som ething is amiss, you have 
advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check you make 
to avoid detection.
D e a t h  St r i k e
Starting at 17th level, you becom e a master of instant 
death. W hen you attack and hit a creature that is 
surprised, it must make a Constitution saving throw 
(DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency 
bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your 
attack against the creature.
A r c a n e  T r i c k s t e r  
Som e rogues enhance their fine-honed skills of stealth 
and agility with magic, learning tricks of enchantment 
and illusion. These rogues include pickpockets and 
burglars, but also pranksters, mischief-makers, and a 
significant number of adventurers.
S p e l l c a s t i n g
W hen you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to 
cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of 
spellcasting and chapter 11 for the w izard spell list.
Cantrips. You learn three cantrips: mage hand and 
two other cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell 
list. You learn another wizard cantrip of your choice 
at 10th level.
Spell Slots. The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting 
table shows how many spell slots you have to cast 
your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these 
spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or 
higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you 
finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell charm 
person and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot 
available, you can cast charm person using either slot.
Spells Known of 
1st-Level and Higher. You know 
three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which 
you must choose from the enchantment and illusion 
spells on the w izard spell list.
The Spells Known colum n of the Arcane Trickster 
Spellcasting table show s when you learn m ore wizard 
spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must 
be an enchantment or illusion spell of your choice, and 
must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For 
instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can 
learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can 
com e from any school of magic.
W henever you gain a level in this class, you can 
replace one o f the wizard spells you know with another 
spell of your choice from  the wizard spell list. The 
new spell must be of a level for which you have spell 
slots, and it must be an enchantment or illusion spell, 
unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th, 
or 20th level.
Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting 
ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your 
spells through dedicated study and memorization.
You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to 
your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your 
Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw 
DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an 
attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
your Intelligence modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + 
your Intelligence modifier
M a g e  H a n d  L e g e r d e m a i n
Starting at 3rd level, when you cast mage hand, you can 
make the spectral hand invisible, and you can perform 
the following additional tasks with it:
•
 You can stow one object the hand is holding in a 
container worn or carried by another creature.
•
 You can retrieve an object in a container worn or 
carried by another creature.
•
 You can use thieves’ tools to pick locks and disarm 
traps at range.

You can perform  one of these tasks without being 
noticed by a creature if you succeed on a Dexterity 
(Sleight of Hand) check contested by the creature’s 
W isdom  (Perception) check.
In addition, you can use the bonus action granted by 
your Cunning Action to control the hand.
M a g i c a l  A m b u s h
Starting at 9th level, if you are hidden from a 
creature when you cast a spell on it, the creature has 
disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against the 
spell this turn.
V e r s a t i l e  T r i c k s t e r
At 13th level, you gain the ability to distract targets with 
your mage hand. As a bonus action on your turn, you can 
designate a creature within 5 feet of the spectral hand 
created by the spell. Doing so gives you advantage on 
attack rolls against that creature until the end of the turn.
S p e l l  T h i e f
At 17th level, you gain the ability to magically 
steal the knowledge of how to cast a spell from 
another spellcaster.
Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets 
you or includes you in its area of effect, you can use your 
reaction to force the creature to make a saving throw 
with its spellcasting ability modifier. The DC equals 
your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the 
spell’s effect against you, and you steal the knowledge 
of the spell if it is at least 1st level and of a level you can 
cast (it doesn’t need to be a wizard spell). For the next 
8 hours, you know the spell and can cast it using your 
spell slots. The creature can’t cast that spell until the 
8 hours have passed.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until 
you finish a long rest.
S or c er er
Golden eyes flashing, a human 
stretches out her hand and unleashes 
the dragonfire that burns in her veins.
As an inferno rages around her foes, 
leathery wings spread from her back and 
she takes to the air.
Long hair whipped by a conjured wind, 
a half-elf spreads his arms wide and throws 
his head back. Lifting him momentarily off 
the ground, a wave of magic surges up in him, 
through him, and out from  him in a mighty blast 
of lightning.
Crouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a 
finger at a charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs 
from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back 
behind the rock formation with a grin, unaware that her 
wild magic has turned her skin bright blue.
Sorcerers carry a m agical birthright conferred 
upon them by an exotic bloodline, som e otherworldly 
influence, or exposure to unknown cosm ic forces.
One can’t study sorcery as one learns a language, any 
m ore than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one 
chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.
Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, 
and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. 
Som e sorcerers wield magic that springs from  an 
ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons. 
Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, 
a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.
The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly 
unpredictable. Som e draconic bloodlines produce 
exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other 
lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most 
of the time, the talents o f sorcery appear as apparent 
flukes. Som e sorcerers can’t name the origin of their 
power, while others trace it to strange events in their 
own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a 
dryad at a baby’s birth, or a taste of the water from 
a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery.
S o too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure 
to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the 
maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the 
inner workings of reality.
Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient 
tom es of m agic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they 
rely on a patron to grant their spells as w arlocks do.
By learning to harness and channel their own inborn 
magic, they can discover new and staggering ways 
to unleash that power.
U n e x p l a i n e d  P o w e r s  
Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it’s unusual to find 
a sorcerer w ho is not involved in the adventuring life 
in som e way. People with magical power seething in 
their veins soon discover that the power doesn’t like to 
stay quiet. A sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded, and 
it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if 
it isn’t called on.

Sorcerers often 
have obscure or quixotic 
motivations driving them 
to adventure. Som e seek a greater 
understanding of the m agical force that infuses 
them, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others 
hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full 
potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit 
as useful to an adventuring party as wizards, making 
up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical 
knowledge with enorm ous flexibility in using the 
spells they know.
C r e a t i n g  a  S o r c e r e r  
The most important question to consider when creating 
your sorcerer is the origin of your power. As a starting 
character, you'll choose an origin that ties to a draconic 
bloodline or the influence of wild magic, but the exact 
source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family 
curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or 
did som e extraordinary event leave you blessed with 
inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?
How do you feel about the magical power coursing 
through you? D o you em brace it, try to master it, or 
revel in its unpredictable nature? Is it a blessing or 
a curse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did 
you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you 
had? W hat do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you 
feel like you’ve been given this power for som e lofty 
purpose. Or you might decide that the power gives you 
the right to do what you want, to take what you want 
from those who lack such power. Perhaps your power
links you to a powerful individual in the world—the fey 
creature that blessed you at birth, the dragon who put 
a drop of its blood into your veins, the lich who created 
you as an experiment, or the deity who chose you to 
carry this power.
Q u i c k  B u i l d
You can make a sorcerer quickly by following these 
suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest 
ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, 
choose the hermit background. Third, choose the 
light, prestidigitation, ray of 
frost, and shocking grasp 
cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells shield and 
magic missile.
C lass F e a t u r e s

S p e l l c a s t i n g  
An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or 
ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with 
arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, 
fuels your spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of 
spellcasting and chapter 11 for the sorcerer spell list.
C a n t r i p s
At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from 
the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer 
cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the 
Cantrips Known colum n of the Sorcerer table.
S p e l l  S l o t s
The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you 
have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast 
one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of 
the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell 
slots when you finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning 
hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot 
available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.
S p e l l s  K n o w n  o f  1s t  L e v e l  a n d  H i g h e r
You know two 1st-level spells o f your choice from the 
sorcerer spell list.
The Spells Known colum n of the Sorcerer table 
show s when you learn more sorcerer spells of your 
choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which 
you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd 
level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st 
or 2nd level.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, 
you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know 
and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer 
spell list, which also must be of a level for which you 
have spell slots.
S p e l l c a s t i n g  A b i l i t y
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer 
spells, since the power of your m agic relies on your 
ability to project your will into the world. You use your 
Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting 
ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier 
when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell 
you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
your Charisma modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + 
your Charisma modifier
S p e l l c a s t i n g  F o c u s
You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a 
spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.
S o r c e r o u s  O r i g i n  
Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the 
source of your innate magical power: Draconic 
Bloodline or W ild Magic, both detailed at the end of the 
class description.
Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 
1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.
F o n t  o f  M a g i c
At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic 
within yourself. This wellspring is represented by 
sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of 
magical effects.
S o r c e r y  P o i n t s
You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain m ore as you 
reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points 
colum n of the Sorcerer table. You can never have 
more sorcery points than shown on the table for your 
level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you 
finish a long rest.
F l e x i b l e  C a s t i n g
You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell 
slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery 
points. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points 
as you reach higher levels.
Creating Spell Slots. You can transform unexpended 
sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on 
your turn. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost 
of creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create 
spell slots no higher in level than 5th.

Converting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points. As a
bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell 
slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the 
slot’s level.
M e t a m a g i c
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells 
to suit your needs. You gain two of the following 
Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another one 
at 10th and 17th level.
You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell 
when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.
C a r e f u l  S p e l l
W hen you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make 
a saving throw, you can protect som e of those creatures 
from the spell’s full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery 
point and choose a number of those creatures up to your 
Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen 
creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw 
against the spell.
D i s t a n t  S p e l l
W hen you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or 
greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the 
range of the spell.
W hen you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you 
can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the 
spell 30 feet.
E m p o w e r e d  S p e l l
W hen you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1
 
sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up 
to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must 
use the new rolls.
You can use Em powered Spell even if you have 
already used a different Metamagic option during the 
casting of the spell.
E x t e n d e d  S p e l l
W hen you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute 
or longer, you can spend 1
 sorcery point to double its 
duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.
H e i g h t e n e d  S p e l l
W hen you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a 
saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery 
points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its 
first saving throw made against the spell.
Q u i c k e n e d  S p e l l
W hen you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, 
you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting 
time to 1 bonus action for this casting.
S u b t l e  S p e l l
W hen you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to 
cast it without any som atic or verbal components.
T w i n n e d  S p e l l
W hen you cast a spell that targets only one creature and 
doesn’t have a range of self, you can spend a number of 
sorcery points equal to the spell’s level to target a second 
creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if 
the spell is a cantrip).
A b i l i t y  S c o r e  I m p r o v e m e n t
W hen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, 
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your 
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of 
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability 
score above 20 using this feature.
S o r c e r o u s  R e s t o r a t i o n
At 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points 
whenever you finish a short rest.
So r c er o u s O r ig in s
Different sorcerers claim  different origins for their 
innate magic. Although many variations exist, most 
of these origins fall into two categories: a draconic 
bloodline and wild magic.
D r a c o n i c  B l o o d l i n e  
Your innate magic com es from draconic m agic that was 
mingled with your blood or that o f your ancestors. Most 
often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent 
back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times w ho made a 
bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed 
a dragon parent. Som e of these bloodlines are well 
established in the world, but most are obscure. Any 
given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a 
result of a pact or som e other exceptional circumstance.
D r a g o n  A n c e s t o r
At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your 
ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon 
is used by features you gain later.

You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, 
whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting 
with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it 
applies to the check.
D r a c o n i c  R e s i l i e n c e
As magic flows through your body, it causes physical 
traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, 
your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 
1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.
Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin 
sheen of dragon-like scales. W hen you aren’t wearing 
armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.
E l e m e n t a l  A f f i n i t y
Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals 
damage of the type associated with your draconic 
ancestry, add your Charisma modifier to that damage.
At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain 
resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.
D r a g o n  W in g s
At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of 
dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed 
equal to your current speed. You can create these wings 
as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you 
dism iss them as a bonus action on your turn.
You can’t manifest your w ings while wearing armor 
unless the armor is made to accom m odate them, and 
clothing not made to accom m odate your wings might 
be destroyed when you manifest them.
D r a c o n i c  P r e s e n c e
Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread 
presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around 
you to becom e awestruck or frightened. As an action, 
you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power 
and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a 
distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your 
concentration (as if you w ere casting a concentration 
spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this 
aura must succeed on a W isdom  saving throw or be 
charm ed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose 
fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on 
this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.
W i l d  M a g i c
Your innate magic com es from the wild forces of chaos 
that underlie the order of creation. You might have 
endured exposure to som e form o f raw magic, perhaps 
through a planar portal leading to Limbo, the Elemental 
Planes, or the mysterious Far Realm. Perhaps you 
were blessed by a powerful fey creature or marked by a 
demon. Or your magic could be a fluke of your birth, with 
no apparent cause or reason. However it cam e to be, this 
chaotic magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.
W i l d  M a g i c  S u r g e
Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your 
spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. 
Immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level 
or higher, the DM can have you roll a d20. If you roll a 
1, roll on the W ild Magic Surge table to create a random 
magical effect.
T id e s  o f  C h a o s
Starting at 1st level, you can manipulate the forces of 
chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll, 
ability check, or saving throw. Once you do so, you must 
finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.
Any time before you regain the use of this feature, the 
DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table 
immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or 
higher. You then regain the use of this feature.
B e n d  L u c k
Starting at 6th level, you have the ability to twist fate 
using your wild magic. W hen another creature you can 
see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving 
throw, you can use your reaction and spend 2 sorcery 
points to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a 
bonus or penalty (your choice) to the creature’s roll. You
can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects 
of the roll occur.
C o n t r o l l e d  C h a o s
At 14th level, you gain a m odicum  of control over the 
surges of your wild magic. W henever you roll on the 
W ild Magic Surge table, you can roll twice and use 
either number.
S p e l l  B o m b a r d m e n t
Beginning at 18th level, the harmful energy of your 
spells intensifies. W hen you roll damage for a spell and 
roll the highest number possible on any of the dice, 
choose one of those dice, roll it again and add that roll to 
the damage. You can use the feature only once per turn.

W a r l o c k
With a pseudodragon curled on his shoulder, a young 
elf in golden robes sm iles warmly, weaving a magical 
charm into his honeyed words and bending the palace 
sentinel to his will.
As flames spring to life in her hands, a wizened 
human whispers the secret name of her dem onic patron, 
infusing her spell with fiendish magic.
Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the 
odd alignment of the stars overhead, a wild-eyed tiefling 
chants the mystic ritual that will open a doorway to a 
distant world.
W arlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies 
hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. Through pacts 
made with mysterious beings of supernatural power, 
warlocks unlock m agical effects both subtle and 
spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of 
beings such as fey nobles, dem ons, devils, hags, and 
alien entities o f the Far Realm, warlocks piece together 
arcane secrets to bolster their own power.
S w o r n  a n d  B e h o l d e n
A w arlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly 
being. Som etim es the relationship between warlock 
and patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though 
the beings that serve as patrons for w arlocks are not 
gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon 
prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity—beings 
not typically served by clerics. More often, though, the 
arrangement is similar to that between a master and 
an apprentice. The warlock learns and grows in power, 
at the cost o f occasional services perform ed on the 
patron’s behalf.
The magic bestowed on a w arlock ranges from  minor 
but lasting alterations to the warlock's being (such as 
the ability to see in darkness or to read any language) 
to access to powerful spells. Unlike bookish wizards, 
w arlocks supplement their magic with som e facility 
at hand-to-hand combat. They are com fortable in light 
armor and know how to use simple weapons.
D e l v e r s  i n t o  S e c r e t s
W arlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge 
and power, which com pels them into their pacts and 
shapes their lives. This thirst drives warlocks into their 
pacts and shapes their later careers as well.
Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends are 
widely known. But many warlocks serve patrons that 
are not fiendish. Som etim es a traveler in the wilds 
com es to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord 
or lady, and stumbles into a pact without being fully 
aware of it. And som etim es, while poring over tom es of

forbidden lore, a brilliant but crazed student’s mind is 
opened to realities beyond the material world and to the 
alien beings that dwell in the outer void.
Once a pact is made, a warlock’s thirst for knowledge 
and power can’t be slaked with mere study and research. 
No one makes a pact with such a mighty patron if he or 
she doesn’t intend to use the power thus gained. Rather, 
the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active 
pursuit of their goals, which typically means som e kind 
of adventuring. Furthermore, the demands of their 
patrons drive warlocks toward adventure.
C r e a t i n g  a  W a r l o c k
As you make your warlock character, spend som e time 
thinking about your patron and the obligations that 
your pact im poses upon you. What led you to make the 
pact, and how  did you make contact with your patron? 
Were you seduced into sum m oning a devil, or did you 
seek out the ritual that would allow you to make contact 
with an alien elder god? Did you search for your patron, 
or did your patron find and choose you? Do you chafe 
under the obligations of your pact or serve joyfully in 
anticipation o f the rewards prom ised to you?
W ork with your DM to determine how big a part your 
pact will play in your character’s adventuring career.
Your patron’s demands might drive you into adventures, 
or they might consist entirely of small favors you can do 
between adventures.
W hat kind of relationship do you have with your 
patron? Is it friendly, antagonistic, uneasy, or romantic? 
H ow important does your patron consider you to be? 
What part do you play in your patron’s plans? Do you 
know other servants of your patron?
How does your patron com m unicate with you? If 
you have a familiar, it might occasionally speak with 
your patron’s voice. Som e warlocks find m essages 
from their patrons etched on trees, mingled am ong tea 
leaves, or adrift in the clouds—m essages that only the 
warlock can see. Other w arlocks converse with their 
patrons in dream s or waking visions, or deal only with 
intermediaries.
Q u i c k  B u i l d
You can make a w arlock quickly by following these 
suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest 
ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose 
the charlatan background. Third, choose the eldritch 
blast and chill touch cantrips, along with the 1st-level 
spells ray o f 
sickness and witch bolt.
C lass F e a t u r e s
As a warlock, you gain the following class features.
H i t  P o i n t s
Hit Dice: 1d8 per warlock level
Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier 
Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) +  
your

E q u i p m e n t
You start with the following equipment, in addition to 
the equipment granted by your background:
•
 (a) a light crossbow  and 20 bolts or (b) any simple 
weapon
•
 (a) a com ponent pouch or (b) an arcane focus
•
 (a) a scholar’s pack or (b) a dungeoneer’s pack
•
 Leather armor, any simple weapon, and two daggers
O t h e r w o r l d l y  P a t r o n
At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an 
otherworldly being of your choice: the Archfey, the 
Fiend, or the Great Old One, each of which is detailed 
at the end of the class description. Your choice 
grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, 
and 14th level.
P a c t  M a g i c
Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you 
by your patron have given you facility with spells. See 
chapter 10 for the general rules o f spellcasting and 
chapter 11 for the w arlock spell list.
C a n t r i p s
You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock 
spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your 
choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known 
colum n of the W arlock table.
S p e l l  S l o t s
The W arlock table shows how many spell slots you have. 
The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all 
of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your 
warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a 
spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you 
finish a short or long rest.
For example, when you are 5th level, you have 
two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell 
thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and 
you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.
S p e l l s  K n o w n  o f  1s t  L e v e l  a n d  H i g h e r  
At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice 
from  the w arlock spell list.
The Spells Known colum n of the W arlock table shows 
when you learn m ore w arlock spells of your choice of 1st 
level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level 
no higher than what’s shown in the table's Slot Level 
colum n for your level. W hen you reach 6th level, for 
example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 
1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, 
you can choose one of the warlock spells you know 
and replace it with another spell from the warlock 
spell list, which also must be of a level for which you 
have spell slots.
S p e l l c a s t i n g  A b i l i t y
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock 
spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers 
to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your 
Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC 
for a w arlock spell you cast and when making an attack 
roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
your Charisma modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + 
your Charisma modifier
S p e l l c a s t i n g  F o c u s
You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a 
spellcasting focus for your w arlock spells.
E l d r i t c h  I n v o c a t i o n s  
In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch 
invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that 
imbue you with an abiding magical ability.
At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your 
choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end 
of the class description. W hen you gain certain w arlock 
levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, 
as shown in the Invocations Known colum n of the 
W arlock table.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, 
you can choose one of the invocations you know and 
replace it with another invocation that you could learn 
at that level.
P a c t  B o o n
At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift 
upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the 
following features of your choice.
Pa c t  o f  t h e  C h a i n
You learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a 
ritual. The spell doesn’t count against your number of 
spells known.
W hen you cast the spell, you can choose one of the 
normal form s for your familiar or one of the following 
special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.
Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can 
forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to 
make one attack of its own.
Pa c t  o f  t h e  B l a d e
You can use your action to create a pact w eapon in your 
empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee 
w eapon takes each time you create it (see chapter 5 for 
w eapon options). You are proficient with it while you 
wield it. This w eapon counts as m agical for the purpose 
of overcom ing resistance and immunity to nonm agical 
attacks and damage.
Your pact w eapon disappears if it is m ore than 5 feet 
away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears 
if you use this feature again, if you dism iss the weapon 
(no action required), or if you die.
You can transform one magic weapon into your pact 
weapon by perform ing a special ritual while you hold 
the weapon. You perform  the ritual over the course 
of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest.
You can then dism iss the weapon, shunting it into an 
extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you 
create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an 
artifact or a sentient w eapon in this way. The weapon 
ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform 
the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use 
a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon 
appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space 
when the bond breaks.
Pa c t  o f  t h e  T o m e
Your patron gives you a grim oire called a B ook of 
Shadows. W hen you gain this feature, choose three 
cantrips from any class’s spell list. W hile the book is on 
your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They 
don’t count against your number of cantrips known.
If you lose your B ook of Shadows, you can perform 
a 1-hour cerem ony to receive a replacement from your 
patron. This cerem ony can be perform ed during a short 
or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book 
turns to ash when you die.
A b i l i t y  S c o r e  I m p r o v e m e n t
W hen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, 
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your 
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of 
your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability 
score above 20 using this feature.
M y s t i c  A r c a n u m
At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical 
secret called an arcanum. C hoose one 6th-level spell 
from the w arlock spell list as this arcanum.
You can cast your arcanum spell once without 
expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before 
you can do so again.
At higher levels, you gain m ore warlock spells of your 
choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell 
at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 
9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your 
Mystic Arcanum  when you finish a long rest.
E l d r i t c h  M a s t e r
At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of 
mystical power while entreating your patron to regain 
expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating 
your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots 
from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots 
with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you 
can do so again.
Yo u r  Pa c t  B o o n
Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an 
object that reflects your patron’s nature.
Pact of 
the Chain. Your familiar is more cunning than a
 
typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your 
patron, with sprites and pseudodragons tied to the Archfey 
and imps and quasits tied to the Fiend. Because the Great Old 
One’s nature is inscrutable, any familiar form is suitable for it.
Pact of 
the Blade. If your patron is the Archfey, your 
weapon might be a slender blade wrapped in leafy vines.
If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made 
of black metal and adorned with decorative flames. If your 
patron is the Great Old One, your weapon might be an 
ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone embedded in its 
head, carved to look like a terrible unblinking eye.
Pact of the Tome. Your Book of Shadows might be a fine, 
gilt-edged tome with spells of enchantment and illusion, 
gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty tome 
bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of 
conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister 
regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend. Or it could be the 
tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with the 
Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only your own 
burgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast.
 
O t h e r w o r ld ly  P a tro n s
The beings that serve as patrons for w arlocks are 
mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence—not 
gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons 
give their w arlocks access to different powers and 
invocations, and expect significant favors in return.
Som e patrons collect w arlocks, doling out mystic 
knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability 
to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their 
power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with 
only one warlock. W arlocks who serve the same patron 
might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.
T h e  A r c h f e y
Your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, a creature of 
legend who holds secrets that were forgotten before 
the mortal races were born. This being’s motivations 
are often inscrutable, and som etim es whimsical, and 
might involve a striving for greater magical power or the 
settling of age-old grudges. Beings of this sort include 
the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness, 
ruler of the Gloam ing Court; Titania of the Sum m er 
Court; her consort Oberon, the Green Lord; Hyrsam, 
the Prince of Fools; and ancient hags.
E x p a n d e d  S p e l l  L i s t
The Archfey lets you choose from an expanded list of 
spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following 
spells are added to the w arlock spell list for you.

F e y  P r e s e n c e
Starting at 1st level, your patron bestows upon you the 
ability to project the beguiling and fearsom e presence 
of the fey. As an action, you can cause each creature in 
a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a W isdom  
saving throw against your w arlock spell save DC. The 
creatures that fail their saving throws are all charm ed 
or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of 
your next turn.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until 
you finish a short or long rest.
M i s t y  E s c a p e
Starting at 6th level, you can vanish in a puff of mist in 
response to harm. W hen you take damage, you can use 
your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet 
to an unoccupied space you can see. You remain invisible 
until the start of your next turn or until you attack or 
cast a spell.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until 
you finish a short or long rest.
B e g u i l i n g  D e f e n s e s
Beginning at 10th level, your patron teaches you how to 
turn the mind-affecting magic of your enem ies against 
them. You are immune to being charmed, and when 
another creature attempts to charm  you, you can use 
your reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on 
that creature. The creature must succeed on a W isdom  
saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or 
be charmed by you for 1 minute or until the creature 
takes any damage.
D a r k  D e l i r i u m
Starting at 14th level, you can plunge a creature into 
an illusory realm. As an action, choose a creature 
that you can see within 60 feet of you. It must make a 
W isdom  saving throw against your warlock spell save 
DC. On a failed save, it is charm ed or frightened by you 
(your choice) for 1 minute or until your concentration 
is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). This 
effect ends early if the creature takes any damage.
Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost 
in a misty realm, the appearance of which you choose. 
The creature can see and hear only itself, you, and 
the illusion.
You must finish a short or long rest before you can 
use this feature again.
T h e  F i e n d  
You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower 
planes o f existence, a being w hose aims are evil, 
even if you strive against those aims. Such beings 
desire the corruption or destruction of all things, 
ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to 
forge a pact include dem on lords such as Dem ogorgon, 
Orcus, Fraz’Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such 
as Asm odeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial; 
pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and 
ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths.

before any of the roll’s effects occur.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until 
you finish a short or long rest.

when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance 
to that damage type until you choose a different one 
with this feature. Damage from m agical w eapons or 
silver w eapons ignores this resistance.
H u r l  T h r o u g h  H e l l
Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an 
attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport 
the target through the lower planes. The creature 
disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.
At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the 
space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied 
space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d 10 psychic 
damage as it reels from  its horrific experience.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until 
you finish a long rest.
T h e  G r e a t  O l d  O n

Your patron is a mysterious entity w hose nature is 
utterly foreign to the fabric of reality. It might com e from 
the Far Realm, the space beyond reality, or it could be 
one of the elder gods known only in legends. Its motives 
are incom prehensible to mortals, and its knowledge so 
im m ense and ancient that even the greatest libraries 
pale in com parison to the vast secrets it holds. The 
Great Old One might be unaware of your existence 
or entirely indifferent to you, but the secrets you have 
learned allow you to draw your magic from it.
Entities of this type include Ghaunadar, called That 
W hich Lurks; Tharizdun, the Chained God; Dendar, the 
Night Serpent; Zargon, the Returner; Great Cthulhu; 
and other unfathomable beings.
E x p a n d e d  S p e l l  L i s t
The Great Old One lets you choose from an expanded list 
of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following 
spells are added to the w arlock spell list for you.
G r e a t  O l d  O n e  E x p a n d e d  S p e l l s

Spells
1st
dissonant whispers, Tasha's hideous laughter
2nd
detect thoughts, phantasm al

3rd
clairvoyance, sending
4th

5th

A w a k e n e d  M i n d
Starting at 1st level, your alien knowledge gives you 
the ability to touch the minds of other creatures. You 
can communicate telepathically with any creature you 
can see within 30 feet of you. You don’t need to share 
a language with the creature for it to understand your 
telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to 
understand at least one language.
E n t r o p i c  W a r d
At 6th level, you learn to magically ward yourself against 
attack and to turn an enemy’s failed strike into good 
luck for yourself. W hen a creature makes an attack 
roll against you, you can use your reaction to im pose 
disadvantage on that roll. If the attack m isses you, your 
next attack roll against the creature has advantage if you 
make it before the end of your next turn.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until 
you finish a short or long rest.
T h o u g h t  S h i e l d
Starting at 10th level, your thoughts can’t be read by 
telepathy or other m eans unless you allow it. You also 
have resistance to psychic damage, and whenever a 
creature deals psychic damage to you, that creature 
takes the sam e amount of damage that you do.
C r e a t e  T h r a l l
At 14th level, you gain the ability to infect a hum anoid’s 
mind with the alien m agic of your patron. You can use 
your action to touch an incapacitated humanoid. That 
creature is then charm ed by you until a remove curse 
spell is cast on it, the charm ed condition is removed 
from it, or you use this feature again.
You can com m unicate telepathically with the charm ed 
creature as long as the two of you are on the same plane 
of existence.

you know. With your B ook of Shadows in hand, you 
can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can’t cast the 
spells except as rituals, unless you’ve learned them by 
som e other means. You can also cast a warlock spell 
you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.
On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to 
your B ook of Shadows. W hen you find such a spell, you 
can add it to the book if the spell’s level is equal to or 
less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you 
can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level 
of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and 
costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.

W iz a r d
Clad in the silver robes that denote her station, an 
elf closes her eyes to shut out the distractions of the 
battlefield and begins her quiet chant. Fingers weaving 
in front of her, she com pletes her spell and launches a 
tiny bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts 
into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers.
Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes 
an intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare stone 
floor, then sprinkles powdered iron along every line and 
graceful curve. W hen the circle is complete, he drones a 
long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle, 
bringing a whiff of brim stone from the otherworldly 
plane beyond.
Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a 
gnom e tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with 
mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over 
them. Closing his eyes to see the visions m ore clearly, 
he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the 
passage to his left.
W izards are supreme magic-users, defined and united 
as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle 
weave of magic that permeates the cosm os, wizards cast 
spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, 
and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures 
monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the 
future, or turns slain foes into zom bies. Their mightiest 
spells change one substance into another, call meteors 
down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.
S c h o l a r s  o f  t h e  A r c a n e
W ild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the 
power of m agic draws students w ho seek to master 
its mysteries. Som e aspire to becom e like the gods, 
shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical 
spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange 
words, fleeting gestures, and som etim es a pinch or 
clump o f exotic materials, these surface com ponents 
barely hint at the expertise attained after years of 
apprenticeship and countless hours of study.
W izards live and die by their spells. Everything else 
is secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment 
and grow in experience. They can also learn them from 
other wizards, from ancient tom es or inscriptions, 
and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are 
steeped in magic.
T h e  L u r e  o f  K n o w l e d g e
W izards’ lives are seldom  mundane. The closest a 
w izard is likely to com e to an ordinary life is working 
as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching 
others the secrets of the multiverse. Other wizards sell 
their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or 
pursue lives of crime or domination.
But the lure o f knowledge and power calls even the 
most unadventurous wizards out of the safety of their 
libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and 
lost cities. M ost w izards believe that their counterparts 
in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have 
been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets 
could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic 
available in the present age.
C r e a t i n g  a  W i z a r d  
__________
Creating a wizard character demands a backstory 
dominated by at least one extraordinary event. How 
did your character first com e into contact with magic? 
How did you discover you had an aptitude for it? Do 
you have a natural talent, or did you simply study 
hard and practice incessantly? Did you encounter a 
magical creature or an ancient tome that taught you the 
basics of magic?
What drew you forth from your life of study? Did your 
first taste of m agical knowledge leave you hungry for 
more? Have you received word of a secret repository 
of knowledge not yet plundered by any other wizard? 
Perhaps you’re simply eager to put your newfound 
magical skills to the test in the face o f danger.
Q u i c k  B u i l d

E q u i p m e n t
You start with the following equipment, in addition to 
the equipment granted by your background:
•
 (a) a quarterstaff or (b) a dagger
•
 (a) a com ponent pouch or (b) an arcane focus
•
 (a) a scholar’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack
•
 A spellbook
S p e l l c a s t i n g
As a student o f arcane magic, you have a spellbook 
containing spells that show  the first glimm erings of 
your true power. See chapter 10 for the general rules of 
spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.
C a n t r i p s
At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice 
from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard 
cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the 
Cantrips Known colum n of the W izard table.
Y o u r  S p e l l b o o k
The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels 
reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well 
as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature 
of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your 
adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in 
an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an 
ancient library.
Copying a Spell into the Book. When you find a wizard spell 
of 1
st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is 
of a level for which you have spell slots and if 
you can spare 
the time to decipher and copy it.
Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing 
the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique 
system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You 
must practice the spell until you understand the sounds 
or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook 
using your own notation.
For each level of 
the spell, the process takes 2 hours and 
costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you 
expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well 
as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent 
this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your 
other spells.
Replacing the Book. You can copy a spell from your own 
spellbook into another book— for example, if you want 
to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like 
copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, 
since you understand your own notation and already know 
how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1
 hour and 10 gp 
for each level of the copied spell.
If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure 
to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new 
spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook 
requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this 
reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.
The Book’s Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique 
compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and 
margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume 
that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound 
gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a
 
loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost 
your previous spellbook in a mishap.
S p e l l b o o k
At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level 
wizard spells of your choice.
P r e p a r i n g  a n d  C a s t i n g  S p e l l s
The W izard table shows how many spell slots you have 
to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of 
these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level 
or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you 
finish a long rest.
You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available 
for you to cast. To do so. choose a number of wizard 
spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence 
modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The 
spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have 
four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an 
Intelligence o f 16, your list of prepared spells can 
include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, 
chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level 
spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 
2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from  
your list of prepared spells.
You can change your list of prepared spells when 
you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard 
spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and 
m em orizing the incantations and gestures you must 
make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level 
for each spell on your list.
S p e l l c a s t i n g  A b i l i t y
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard 
spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated 
study and memorization. You use your Intelligence 
whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
In addition, you use your Intelligence m odifier when 
setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast 
and when making an attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
your Intelligence modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + 
your intelligence modifier
R i t u a l  C a s t i n g
You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has 
the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. 
You don't need to have the spell prepared.
S p e l l c a s t i n g  F o c u s
You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a 
spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.
L e a r n i n g  S p e l l s  o f  1s t  L e v e l  a n d  H i g h e r
Each time you gain a w izard level, you can add two 
wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each 
of these spells must be of a level for which you have 
spell slots, as shown on the W izard table. On your 
adventures, you might find other spells that you can add 
to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).
A r c a n e  R e c o v e r y
You have learned to regain som e of your magical energy 
by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you 
finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots 
to recover. The spell slots can have a com bined level that 
is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded 
up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.
For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover 
up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either 
a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.
A r c a n e  T r a d i t i o n
W hen you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane 
tradition, shaping your practice o f magic through one 
of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, 
Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, 
or Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the 
class description.
Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again 
at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.
A b i l i t y  S c o r e  I m p r o v e m e n t
W hen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, 
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your 
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of 
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability 
score above 20 using this feature.
S p e l l  M a s t e r y
At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over 
certain spells that you can cast them at will. C hoose a 
1st-level w izard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that 
are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their 
lowest level without expending a spell slot when you 
have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a 
higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.
By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one 
or both o f the spells you chose for different spells of 
the sam e levels.
S i g n a t u r e  S p e l l s
W hen you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two 
powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. 
Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook 
as your signature spells. You always have these spells 
prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells 
you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 
3rd level without expending a spell slot. W hen you do so, 
you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you 
must expend a spell slot as normal.
A r c a n e  T r a d it io n s
The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to 
the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly 
established in the worlds of D&D, with various 
traditions dedicated to its com plex study.
The most com m on arcane traditions in the multiverse 
revolve around the schools of magic. W izards through
the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping 
them into eight categories called schools, as described 
in chapter 10. In som e places, these traditions are 
literally schools; a w izard might study at the School of 
Illusion while another studies across town at the School 
of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are 
m ore like academ ic departments, with rival faculties 
com peting for students and funding. Even w izards who 
train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use 
the division of magic into schools as a learning device, 
since the spells of each school require mastery of 
different techniques.
S c h o o l  o f  A b j u r a t i o n
The School of Abjuration em phasizes magic that blocks, 
banishes, or protects. Detractors of this school say 
that its tradition is about denial, negation rather than 
positive assertion. You understand, however, that ending 
harmful effects, protecting the weak, and banishing evil 
influences is anything but a philosophical void. It is a 
proud and respected vocation.
Called abjurers, m em bers of this school are sought 
when baleful spirits require exorcism , when important 
locations must be guarded against magical spying, and 
when portals to other planes of existence must be closed.
A b j u r a t i o n  Sa v a n t
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the 
gold and time you must spend to copy an abjuration 
spell into your spellbook is halved.
A r c a n e  W a r d
Starting at 2nd level, you can weave magic around 
yourself for protection. W hen you cast an abjuration 
spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a 
strand of the spell’s magic to create a magical ward on 
yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward 
has hit points equal to twice your wizard level + your 
Intelligence modifier. W henever you take damage, the 
ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces 
the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.
W hile the ward has 0 hit points, it can’t absorb 
damage, but its magic remains. W henever you cast an 
abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a 
number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell.
Once you create the ward, you can't create it again 
until you finish a long rest.
P r o j e c t e d  W a r d
Starting at 6th level, when a creature that you can see 
within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your 
reaction to cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that 
damage. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, 
the warded creature takes any remaining damage.
I m p r o v e d  A b j u r a t i o n
Beginning at 10th level, when you cast an abjuration 
spell that requires you to make an ability check as 
a part of casting that spell (as in counterspell and 
dispel magic), you add your proficiency bonus to that 
ability check.
S p e l l  R e s i s t a n c e
Starting at 14th level, you have advantage on saving 
throws against spells.
Furthermore, you have resistance against the 
damage of spells.
S c h o o l  o f  C o n j u r a t i o n
As a conjurer, you favor spells that produce objects 
and creatures out o f thin air. You can conjure billowing 
clouds of killing fog or sum m on creatures from 
elsewhere to fight on your behalf. As your mastery 
grows, you learn spells of transportation and can 
teleport yourself across vast distances, even to other 
planes of existence, in an instant.
C o n j u r a t i o n  S a v a n t
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the 
gold and time you must spend to copy a conjuration spell 
into your spellbook is halved.
M i n o r  C o n j u r a t i o n
Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you 
can use your action to conjure up an inanimate object 
in your hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space 
that you can see within 10 feet of you. This object can be 
no larger than 3 feet on a side and weigh no m ore than 
10 pounds, and its form must be that of a nonm agical
object that you have seen. The object is visibly magical, 
radiating dim light out to 5 feet.
The object disappears after 1 hour, when you use this 
feature again, or if it takes any damage.
B e n i g n  T r a n s p o s i t i o n
Starting at 6th level, you can use your action to teleport 
up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. 
Alternatively, you can choose a space within range 
that is occupied by a Small or M edium creature. If that 
creature is willing, you both teleport, swapping places.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until 
you finish a long rest or you cast a conjuration spell of 
1st level or higher.
F o c u s e d  C o n j u r a t i o n
Beginning at 10th level, while you are concentrating on 
a conjuration spell, your concentration can’t be broken 
as a result of taking damage.
D u r a b l e  S u m m o n s
Starting at 14th level, any creature that you 
sum m on or create with a conjuration spell has 30 
temporary hit points.
S c h o o l  o f  D i v i n a t i o n  
The counsel of a diviner is sought by royalty and 
com m oners alike, for all seek a clearer understanding 
of the past, present, and future. As a diviner, you strive 
to part the veils of space, time, and consciousness so 
that you can see clearly. You work to master spells of 
discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge, 
and foresight.
D i v i n a t i o n  Sa v a n t
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the 
gold and time you must spend to copy a divination spell 
into your spellbook is halved.
P o r t e n t
Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, 
glim pses of the future begin to press in on your 
awareness. W hen you finish a long rest, roll two d20s 
and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any 
attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or 
a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling 
rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you 
can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.
Each foretelling roll can be used only once. W hen you 
finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.
E x p e r t  D i v i n a t i o n
Beginning at 6th level, casting divination spells com es 
so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your 
spellcasting efforts. W hen you cast a divination spell 
of 2nd level or higher using a spell slot, you regain one 
expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a 
level lower than the spell you cast and can’t be higher 
than 5th level.
T h e  T h i r d  E y e
Starting at 10th level, you can use your action to 
increase your powers o f perception. W hen you do so,
choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until 
you are incapacitated or you take a short or long rest. 
You can’t use the feature again until you finish a rest.
Darkvision. You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 
feet, as described in chapter 8.
Ethereal Sight. You can see into the Ethereal Plane 
within 60 feet of you.
Greater Comprehension. You can read any language. 
See Invisibility. You can see invisible creatures and 
objects within 10 feet of you that are within line of sight.
G r e a t e r  P o r t e n t
Starting at 14th level, the visions in your dreams 
intensify and paint a m ore accurate picture in your mind 
of what is to com e. You roll three d20s for your Portent 
feature, rather than two.
S c h o o l  o f  E n c h a n t m e n t
As a m em ber of the School of Enchantment, you have 
honed your ability to magically entrance and beguile 
other people and monsters. Som e enchanters are 
peacem akers w ho bewitch the violent to lay down their 
arms and charm the cruel into showing mercy. Others 
are tyrants w ho magically bind the unwilling into their 
service. Most enchanters fall som ewhere in between.
E n c h a n t m e n t  Sa v a n t
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the 
gold and time you must spend to copy an enchantment 
spell into your spellbook is halved.
H y p n o t i c  G a z e
Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, your 
soft w ords and enchanting gaze can magically enthrall 
another creature. As an action, choose one creature that 
you can see within 5 feet of you. If the target can see or 
hear you, it must succeed on a W isdom  saving throw 
against your wizard spell save DC or be charm ed by you 
until the end of your next turn. The charm ed creature’s 
speed drops to 0, and the creature is incapacitated and 
visibly dazed.
On subsequent turns, you can use your action to 
maintain this effect, extending its duration until the 
end of your next turn. However, the effect ends if you 
move m ore than 5 feet away from the creature, if the 
creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature 
takes damage.
Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its 
initial saving throw against this effect, you can’t use this 
feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.
I n s t i n c t i v e  C h a r m
Beginning at 6th level, when a creature you can see 
within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll against 
you, you can use your reaction to divert the attack, 
provided that another creature is within the attack’s 
range. The attacker must make a W isdom  saving throw 
against your wizard spell save DC. On a failed save, 
the attacker must target the creature that is closest 
to it, not including you or itself. If multiple creatures 
are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target.
On a successful save, you can’t use this feature on the 
attacker again until you finish a long rest.
You must choose to use this feature before knowing 
whether the attack hits or m isses. Creatures that can’t 
be charm ed are immune to this effect.
S p l i t  E n c h a n t m e n t
Starting at 10th level, when you cast an enchantment 
spell of 1st level or higher that targets only one creature, 
you can have it target a second creature.
A l t e r  M e m o r i e s
At 14th level, you gain the ability to make a creature 
unaware of your magical influence on it. W hen you cast 
an enchantment spell to charm one or m ore creatures, 
you can alter one creature’s understanding so that it 
remains unaware of being charmed.
Additionally, once before the spell expires, you can 
use your action to try to make the chosen creature 
forget som e of the time it spent charmed. The creature 
must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against 
your wizard spell save DC or lose a number of hours 
of its m em ories equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier 
(minimum 1). You can make the creature forget less 
time, and the amount of time can’t exceed the duration 
of your enchantment spell.
S c h o o l  o f  E v o c a t i o n  
You focus your study on magic that creates powerful 
elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, 
rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. 
Som e evokers find employment in military forces, 
serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. 
Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, 
while som e seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, 
or aspiring tyrants.
E v o c a t i o n  Sa v a n t
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the 
gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell 
into your spellbook is halved.
S c u l p t  S p e l l s
Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of 
relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. 
W hen you cast an evocation spell that affects other 
creatures that you can see, you can choose a number 
of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen 
creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws 
against the spell, and they take no damage if they would 
normally take half damage on a successful save.
P o t e n t  C a n t r i p
Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect 
even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. W hen 
a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your 
cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if 
any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.
E m p o w e r e d  E v o c a t i o n
Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence 
m odifier to the damage roll of any wizard evocation 
spell you cast.
O v e r c h a n n e l
Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of 
your simpler spells. W hen you cast a wizard spell of 
5th level or lower that deals damage, you can deal 
maximum damage with that spell.
The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. 
If you use this feature again before you finish a long 
rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of 
the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you 
use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the 
necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d 12. This 
damage ignores resistance and immunity.
S c h o o l  o f  I l l u s i o n
You focus your studies on magic that dazzles the 
senses, befuddles the mind, and tricks even the wisest 
folk. Your magic is subtle, but the illusions crafted by 
your keen mind make the im possible seem  real. Som e 
illusionists—including many gnom e w izards—are 
benign tricksters w ho use their spells to entertain. 
Others are m ore sinister masters of deception, using 
their illusions to frighten and fool others for their 
personal gain.
I l l u s i o n  Sa v a n t
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the 
gold and time you must spend to copy an illusion spell 
into your spellbook is halved.
I m p r o v e d  M i n o r  I l l u s i o n
W hen you choose this school at 2nd level, you learn 
the minor illusion cantrip. If you already know this 
cantrip, you learn a different w izard cantrip of your
choice. The cantrip doesn’t count against your number 
of cantrips known.
W hen you cast minor illusion, you can create both a 
sound and an image with a single casting o f the spell.
M a l l e a b l e  I l l u s i o n s
Starting at 6th level, when you cast an illusion spell that 
has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can use your 
action to change the nature of that illusion (using the 
spell’s normal parameters for the illusion), provided that 
you can see the illusion.
I l l u s o r y  S e l f
Beginning at 10th level, you can create an illusory 
duplicate of yourself as an instant, almost instinctual 
reaction to danger. W hen a creature makes an attack 
roll against you, you can use your reaction to interpose 
the illusory duplicate between the attacker and 
yourself. The attack automatically m isses you, then the 
illusion dissipates.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until 
you finish a short or long rest.
I l l u s o r y  R e a l i t y
By 14th level, you have learned the secret of weaving 
shadow magic into your illusions to give them a sem i- 
reality. W hen you cast an illusion spell of 1st level or 
higher, you can choose one inanimate, nonm agical 
object that is part of the illusion and make that object 
real. You can do this on your turn as a bonus action 
while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 
1 minute. For example, you can create an illusion of a 
bridge over a chasm and then make it real long enough 
for your allies to cross.
The object can’t deal damage or otherwise 
directly harm anyone.
S c h o o l  o f  N e c r o m a n c y
The School of Necrom ancy explores the cosm ic forces 
of life, death, and undeath. As you focus your studies in 
this tradition, you learn to manipulate the energy that 
animates all living things. As you progress, you learn to 
sap the life force from a creature as your magic destroys 
its body, transforming that vital energy into magical 
power you can manipulate.
Most people see necrom ancers as menacing, or even 
villainous, due to the close association with death.
Not all necrom ancers are evil, but the forces they 
manipulate are considered taboo by many societies.
N e c r o m a n c y  S a v a n t
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the 
gold and time you must spend to copy a necrom ancy 
spell into your spellbook is halved.
G r i m  H a r v e s t
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to reap life energy from 
creatures you kill with your spells. Once per turn when 
you kill one or m ore creatures with a spell of 1st level 
or higher, you regain hit points equal to twice the spell’s 
level, or three times its level if the spell belongs to the 
School of Necromancy. You don’t gain this benefit for 
killing constructs or undead.
U n d e a d  T h r a l l s
At 6th level, you add the animate dead spell to your 
spellbook if it is not there already. W hen you cast 
animate dead, you can target one additional corpse 
or pile of bones, creating another zom bie or skeleton, 
as appropriate.
W henever you create an undead using a necrom ancy 
spell, it has additional benefits:
•
 The creature’s hit point maximum is increased by an 
amount equal to your wizard level.
•
 The creature adds your proficiency bonus to its 
weapon damage rolls.
I n u r e d  t o  U n d e a t h
Beginning at 10th level, you have resistance to necrotic 
damage, and your hit point maximum can't be reduced. 
You have spent so much time dealing with undead and 
the forces that animate them that you have becom e 
inured to som e of their worst effects.
C o m m a n d  U n d e a d
Starting at 14th level, you can use m agic to bring 
undead under your control, even those created by other 
wizards. As an action, you can choose one undead that 
you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must 
make a Charisma saving throw against your wizard 
spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can’t use this feature 
on it again. If it fails, it becom es friendly to you and 
obeys your com m ands until you use this feature again.
Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way.
If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has 
advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving 
throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can 
repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it 
succeeds and breaks free.
S c h o o l  o f  T r a n s m u t a t i o n
You are a student of spells that modify energy and matter. 
To you, the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently 
mutable, and you delight in being an agent of change.
You wield the raw stuff of creation and learn to alter both 
physical forms and mental qualities. Your magic gives 
you the tools to becom e a smith on reality’s forge.
Som e transmuters are tinkerers and pranksters, 
turning people into toads and transforming copper into 
silver for fun and occasional profit. Others pursue their 
magical studies with deadly seriousness, seeking the 
power o f the gods to make and destroy worlds.
T r a n s m u t a t i o n  Sa v a n t
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the 
gold and time you must spend to copy a transmutation 
spell into your spellbook is halved.
M i n o r  A l c h e m y
Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you 
can temporarily alter the physical properties of one 
nonm agical object, changing it from one substance into 
another. You perform  a special alchemical procedure 
on one object com posed entirely of w ood, stone (but not 
a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into 
a different one of those materials. For each 10 minutes
you spend perform ing the procedure, you can transform 
up to 1 cubic foot of material. After 1 hour, or until you 
lose your concentration (as if you w ere concentrating on 
a spell), the material reverts to its original substance.
T r a n s m u t e r ’s St o n e
Starting at 6th level, you can spend 8 hours creating a 
transmuter’s stone that stores transmutation magic. You 
can benefit from the stone yourself or give it to another 
creature. A creature gains a benefit of your choice 
as long as the stone is in the creature’s possession. 
W hen you create the stone, choose the benefit from the 
following options:
•
 Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, as described in 
chapter 8
•
 An increase to speed of 10 feet while the creature is 
unencumbered
•
 Proficiency in Constitution saving throws
•
 Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder 
damage (your choice whenever you choose this 
benefit)
Each time you cast a transmutation spell of 1st level 
or higher, you can change the effect of your stone if the 
stone is on your person.
If you create a new transmuter’s stone, the previous 
one ceases to function.
S h a p e c h a n g e r
At 10th level, you add the polymorph spell to your 
spellbook, if it is not there already. You can cast 
polymorph without expending a spell slot. W hen you 
do so, you can target only yourself and transform into a 
beast w hose challenge rating is 1 or lower.
Once you cast polymorph in this way, you can’t do so 
again until you finish a short or long rest, though you 
can still cast it normally using an available spell slot.
M a s t e r  T r a n s m u t e r  
Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to 
consum e the reserve of transmutation magic stored 
within your transmuter’s stone in a single burst. W hen 
you do so, choose one of the following effects. Your 
transmuter’s stone is destroyed and can’t be remade 
until you finish a long rest.
Major Transformation. You can transmute one 
nonm agical object—no larger than a 5-foot cube—into 
another nonm agical object of similar size and m ass and 
of equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes 
handling the object to transform it.
Panacea. You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons 
affecting a creature that you touch with the transmuter’s 
stone. The creature also regains all its hit points.
Restore Life. You cast the raise dead spell on a 
creature you touch with the transmuter’s stone, without 
expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in 
your spellbook.
Restore Youth. You touch the transmuter’s stone to 
a willing creature, and that creature’s apparent age is 
reduced by 3 d 10 years, to a minimum of 13 years. This 
effect doesn’t extend the creature’s lifespan.
C h a p t e r  4: Pe r s o n a l i t y  a n d  Ba c k g r o u n d
CH
ARACTERS ARE DEFINED BY MUCH MORE THAN
their race and class. They’re individuals with 
their own stories, interests, connections, and 
capabilities beyond those that class and race 
define. This chapter expounds on the details 
that distinguish characters from one another, 
including the basics of name and physical description, 
the rules of backgrounds and languages, and the finer 
points of personality and alignment.
C h a r a c t e r  D e t a il s
Your character’s name and physical description might 
be the first things that the other players at the table 
learn about you. It’s worth thinking about how  these 
characteristics reflect the character you have in mind.
N a m e
Your character’s race description includes sample 
names for m em bers o f that race. Put som e thought into 
your name even if you’re just picking one from a list.
S e x
You can play a male or female character without gaining 
any special benefits or hindrances. Think about how 
your character does or does not conform  to the broader 
culture’s expectations of sex, gender, and sexual 
behavior. For example, a male drow  cleric defies the 
traditional gender divisions of drow society, which could 
be a reason for your character to leave that society and 
com e to the surface.
T i k a  a n d  A r t e m i s : C o n t r a s t i n g  C h a r a c t e r s
The details in this chapter make a big difference in setting 
your character apart from every other character. Consider the 
following two human fighters.
Hailing from the Dragonlance setting, Tika Waylan was a 
brash teenager who had a rough childhood. The daughter of 
a thief, she ran away from home and practiced her father’s 
trade on the streets of Solace. When she tried to rob the 
proprietor of the Inn of the Last Home, he caught her and 
took her under his wing, giving her a job as a barmaid. But 
when the dragonarmies laid waste to the town of Solace 
and destroyed the inn, necessity forced Tika into adventure 
alongside the friends she’d known from her childhood. Her 
skill as a fighter (a frying pan remains one of her favorite 
weapons) combined with her history on the streets gave her 
skills invaluable in her adventuring career.
Artemis Entreri grew up on the streets of Calimport in the 
Forgotten Realms. He used his wits, strength, and agility 
to carve out his own territory in one of 
the city's hundreds 
of poor shanty towns. After several years, he attracted the 
notice of one of the most powerful thieves’ guilds in the city, 
and he ascended the ranks of the guild quickly despite his 
youth. Artemis became the favored assassin of one of the 
city’s pashas, who sent him to far-off Icewind Dale to recover 
some stolen gems. He’s a professional killer, constantly 
challenging himself to improve his skills.
Tika and Artemis are both human and both fighters (with 
some experience as rogues), possessing similarly high 
Strength and Dexterity scores, but there the similarity ends.
You don’t need to be confined to binary notions of 
sex and gender. The elf god Corellon Larethian is often 
seen as androgynous or hermaphroditic, for example, 
and som e elves in the multiverse are made in Corellon’s 
image. You could also play a female character who 
presents herself as a man, a man w ho feels trapped in a 
female body, or a bearded female dwarf who hates being 
mistaken for a male. Likewise, your character’s sexual 
orientation is for you to decide.
H e i g h t  a n d  W e i g h t
You can decide your character’s height and weight, 
using the information provided in your race description 
or on the Random  Height and Weight table. Think about 
what your character’s ability scores might say about his 
or her height and weight. A weak but agile character 
might be thin. A strong and tough character might be 
tall or just heavy.
If you want to, you can roll randomly for your 
character’s height and weight using the Random  Height 
and W eight table. The dice roll given in the Height 
Modifier colum n determines the character’s extra 
height (in inches) beyond the base height. That same 
num ber multiplied by the dice roll or quantity given in 
the Weight Modifier colum n determines the character’s 
extra weight (in pounds) beyond the base weight.

For example, as a human, Tika has a height of 4 feet 8 
inches plus 2d10 inches. Her player rolls 2 d 10 and gets 
a total of 12, so Tika stands 5 feet 8 inches tall. Then 
the player uses that sam e roll of 12 and multiplies it by 
2d4 pounds. Her 2d4 roll is 3, so Tika weighs an extra 
36 pounds ( 1 2  
x  
3) on top of her base 110 pounds, for a 
total of 146 pounds.

You choose your character’s age and the color of 
his or her hair, eyes, and skin. To add a touch of 
distinctiveness, you might want to give your character 
an unusual or memorable physical characteristic, such 
as a scar, a limp, or a tattoo.
T i k a  a n d  A r t e m i s : C h a r a c t e r  D e t a i l s
Consider how the names Tika Waylan and Artemis Entreri 
set these characters apart from each other and reflect their 
personalities. Tika is a young woman determined to prove 
that she's not just a kid any more, and her name makes her 
sound young and ordinary. Artemis Entreri comes from an 
exotic land and carries a more mysterious name.
Tika is nineteen years old at the start of her adventuring 
career and has auburn hair, green eyes, fair skin with freckles, 
and a mole on her right hip. Artemis is a small man, compact 
and all wiry muscle. He has angular features and high 
cheekbones, and he always seems in need of a shave. His 
raven-black hair is thick and full, but his eyes are gray and 
lifeless— betraying the emptiness of his life and soul.
A l i g n m e n t
A typical creature in the worlds of D u n g e o n s  & 
D r a g o n s  has an alignment, which broadly describes 
its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a 
combination of two factors: one identifies morality 
(good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes 
attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, 
or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the 
possible combinations.
These brief sum m aries of the nine alignments 
describe the typical behavior of a creature with that 
alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from 
that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and 
consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.
Lawful good (LG) creatures can be counted on to do 
the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, 
paladins, and m ost dwarves are lawful good.
Neutral good (NG) folk do the best they can to help 
others according to their needs. Many celestials, som e 
cloud giants, and most gnom es are neutral good.
Chaotic good (CG) creatures act as their conscience 
directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper 
dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.
Lawful neutral (LN) individuals act in accordance 
with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many m onks and 
som e w izards are lawful neutral.
Neutral (N) is the alignment of those w ho prefer to 
steer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides,
D w a r v i s h  S c r i p t : S a m p l e  A l p h a b e t
doing what seem s best at the time. Lizardfolk, most 
druids, and many humans are neutral.
Chaotic neutral (CN) creatures follow their whims, 
holding their personal freedom  above all else.
Many barbarians and rogues, and som e bards, are 
chaotic neutral.
Lawful evil (LE) creatures methodically take what they 
want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or 
order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.
Neutral evil (NE) is the alignment of those who do 
whatever they can get away with, without com passion or 
qualms. Many drow, som e cloud giants, and yugoloths 
are neutral evil.
Chaotic evil (CE) creatures act with arbitrary 
violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. 
Demons, red dragons, and orc s are chaotic evil.
A l i g n m e n t  i n  t h e  M u l t i v e r s e  
For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral 
choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid 
races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or 
evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good-aligned 
gods w ho created these races gave them free will to 
choose their moral paths, knowing that good without 
free will is slavery.
The evil deities w ho created other races, though, made 
those races to serve them. Those races have strong 
inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. 
Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc 
god, Gruumsh, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if 
an orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its 
innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel 
the lingering pull of the orc god’s influence.)
Alignment is an essential part of the nature of 
celestials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be 
lawful evil, and it doesn’t tend toward lawful evil, but 
rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it som ehow  
ceased to be lawful evil, it w ould cease to be a devil.
Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational 
thought do not have alignments—they are unaligned. 
Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or 
ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. 
Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are 
not evil; they have no alignment.
L a n g u a g e s  
Your race indicates the languages your character can 
speak by default, and your background might give you 
access to one or m ore additional languages o f your 
choice. Note these languages on your character sheet.
C hoose your languages from  the Standard Languages 
table, or choose one that is com m on in your campaign. 
With your DM ’s perm ission, you can instead choose a 
language from the Exotic Languages table or a secret 
language, such as thieves’ cant or the tongue of druids.
Som e of these languages are actually families 
of languages with many dialects. For example, the 
Primordial language includes the Auran, Aquan, Ignan, 
and Terran dialects, one for each of the four elemental 
planes. Creatures that speak different dialects o f the 
sam e language can com m unicate with one another.

T i k a  a n d  A r t e m i s : A l i g n m e n t
Tika Waylan is neutral good, fundamentally good-hearted 
and striving to help others where she can. Artemis is lawful 
evil, unconcerned with the value of sentient life but at least 
professional in his approach to murder.
As an evil character, Artemis is not an ideal adventurer. He 
began his career as a villain, and only cooperates with heroes 
when he must— and when it’s in his own best interests. In
 
most games, evil adventurers cause problems in groups 
alongside others who don’t share their interests and objectives. 
Generally, evil alignments are for villains and monsters.
P e r s o n a l  C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s
Fleshing out your character’s personality—the array of 
traits, mannerisms, habits, beliefs, and flaws that give 
a person a unique identity—will help you bring him 
or her to life as you play the game. Four categories of 
characteristics are presented here: personality traits, 
ideals, bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, 
think about your character’s favorite w ords or phrases, 
tics and habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and 
whatever else you can imagine.
Each background presented later in this chapter 
includes suggested characteristics that you can use 
to spark your imagination. You’re not bound to those 
options, but they’re a good starting point.
P e r s o n a l i t y  T r a i t s
Give your character two personality traits. Personality 
traits are small, simple ways to help you set your 
character apart from  every other character. Your 
personality traits should tell you som ething interesting 
and fun about your character. They should be self- 
descriptions that are specific about what makes your 
character stand out. “I’m sm art” is not a good trait, 
because it describes a lot of characters. “I’ve read every 
book in Candlekeep” tells you som ething specific about 
your character’s interests and disposition.
Personality traits might describe the things your 
character likes, his or her past accomplishments, things 
your character dislikes or fears, your character’s self- 
attitude or mannerisms, or the influence o f his or her 
ability scores.
E l v i s h  S c r i p t : S a m p l e  A l p h a b e t
T i k a  a n d  A r t e m i s : P e r s o n a l  C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s
Tika and Artemis have distinct personality traits. Tika Waylan 
dislikes boastfulness and has a fear of heights resulting 
from a bad fall during her career as a thief. Artemis Entreri 
is always prepared for the worst and moves with a quick, 
precise confidence.
Consider their ideals. Tika Waylan is innocent, almost 
childlike, believing in the value of life and the importance of 
appreciating everyone. Neutral good in alignment, she cleaves 
to ideals of life and respect. Artemis Entreri never allows 
his emotions to master him, and he constantly challenges 
himself to improve his skills. His lawful evil alignment gives 
him ideals of impartiality and a lust for power.
Tika Waylan’s bond is to the Inn of 
the Last Home. The 
inn’s proprietor gave her a new chance at life, and her 
friendship with her adventuring companions was forged 
during her time working there. Its destruction by the 
marauding dragonarmies gives Tika a very personal reason to 
hate them with a fiery passion. Her bond might be phrased 
as “ I
 will do whatever it takes to punish the dragonarmies for 
the destruction of the Inn of 
the Last Home.”
Artemis Entreri’s bond is a strange, almost paradoxical 
relationship with Drizzt Do’Urden, his equal in swordplay 
and grim determination. In
 his first battle with Drizzt,
Artemis recognized something of himself in his opponent, 
some indication that if his life had gone differently, he 
might have led a life more like the heroic drow’s. From that 
moment, Artemis is more than a criminal assassin— he is an 
antihero, driven by his rivalry with Drizzt. His bond might be 
phrased as “ I
 will not rest until I
 have proved myself better 
than Drizzt Do’Urden.”
Each of 
these characters also has an important flaw.
Tika Waylan is naive and emotionally vulnerable, younger 
than her companions and annoyed that they still think 
of her as the kid they knew years ago. She might even be 
tempted to act against her principles if she's convinced that 
a particular achievement would demonstrate her maturity. 
Artemis Entreri is completely walled off 
from any personal 
relationship and just wants to be left alone.
A useful place to start thinking about personality 
traits is to look at your highest and lowest ability scores 
and define one trait related to each. Either one could be 
positive or negative: you might work hard to overcome a 
low score, for example, or be cocky about your high score.
D r a c o n i c  S c r i p t : S a m p l e  A l p h a b e t
I d e a l s
Describe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideals 
are the things that you believe in m ost strongly, the 
fundamental moral and ethical principles that com pel you 
to act as you do. Ideals encom pass everything from your 
life goals to your core belief system.
Ideals might answer any of these questions: What are 
the principles that you will never betray? What would 
prompt you to make sacrifices? What drives you to act 
and guides your goals and ambitions? W hat is the single 
most important thing you strive for?
You can choose any ideals you like, but your 
character’s alignment is a good place to start defining 
them. Each background in this chapter includes six 
suggested ideals. Five of them are linked to aspects of 
alignment: law, chaos, good, evil, and neutrality. The last 
one has m ore to do with the particular background than 
with moral or ethical perspectives.
B o n d s
Create one bond for your character. Bonds represent a 
character’s connections to people, places, and events in 
the world. They tie you to things from your background. 
They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead 
you to act against your own best interests if they are 
threatened. They can w ork very much like ideals, 
driving a character’s motivations and goals.
Bonds might answer any of these questions: W hom  do 
you care m ost about? To what place do you feel a special 
connection? What is your most treasured possession?
Your bonds might be tied to your class, your 
background, your race, or som e other aspect of your 
character’s history or personality. You might also gain 
new bonds over the course of your adventures.
F l a w s
Finally, choose a flaw for your character. Your 
character’s flaw represents som e vice, compulsion, fear, 
or w eakness—in particular, anything that som eone 
else could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to 
act against your best interests. More significant than 
negative personality traits, a flaw might answer any 
of these questions: What enrages you? W hat’s the one 
person, concept, or event that you are terrified of? What 
are your vices?
In s p ir a t io n
Inspiration is a rule the Dungeon Master can use to 
reward you for playing your character in a way that’s 
true to his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. 
By using inspiration, you can draw on your personality 
trait of com passion for the downtrodden to give you 
an edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or 
inspiration can let you call on your bond to the defense 
of your home village to push past the effect of a spell 
that has been laid on you.
G a i n i n g  I n s p i r a t i o n
Your DM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety 
of reasons. Typically, DMs award it when you play 
out your personality traits, give in to the drawbacks 
presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your 
character in a com pelling way. Your DM will tell you 
how you can earn inspiration in the game.
You either have inspiration or you don’t—you can’t 
stockpile multiple “inspirations” for later use.
U s i n g  I n s p i r a t i o n
If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make 
an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending 
your inspiration gives you advantage on that roll.
Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward 
another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, 
or simply doing som ething exciting in the game.
W hen another player character does som ething that 
really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting 
way, you can give up your inspiration to give that 
character inspiration.
Ba c k g r o u n d s
Every story has a beginning. Your character’s 
background reveals w here you cam e from, how you 
becam e an adventurer, and your place in the world.
Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a 
grizzled soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or 
an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild 
thief or com m anded audiences as a jester.
Choosing a background provides you with important 
story cues about your character’s identity. The most 
important question to ask about your background is 
what changed? W hy did you stop doing whatever your 
background describes and start adventuring? W here 
did you get the m oney to purchase your starting gear, or, 
if you com e from  a wealthy background, why don't you 
have more money? H ow did you learn the skills of your 
class? W hat sets you apart from  ordinary people who 
share your background?
T i k a  a n d  A r t e m i s : Ba c k g r o u n d s
Tika Waylan and Artemis Entreri both lived their earliest years 
as street urchins. Tika’s later career as a barmaid didn’t really 
change her, so she might choose the urchin background, 
gaining proficiency in the Sleight of Hand and Stealth skills, 
and learning the tools of the thieving trade. Artemis is more 
defined by his criminal background, giving him skills in
 
Deception and Stealth, as well as proficiency with the tools of 
thievery and poison.
The sample backgrounds in this chapter provide 
both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and 
languages) and roleplaying suggestions.
P r o f i c i e n c i e s
Each background gives a character proficiency in two 
skills. Skills are described in chapter 7.
In addition, most backgrounds give a character 
proficiency with one or m ore tools. Tools and tool 
proficiencies are detailed in chapter 5.
If a character would gain the same proficiency from 
two different sources, he or she can choose a different 
proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.
L a n g u a g e s
Som e backgrounds also allow characters to learn 
additional languages beyond those given by race.
See “Languages” earlier in this chapter.
E q u i p m e n t
Each background provides a package of starting 
equipment. If you use the optional rule from chapter 5 
to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting 
equipment from your background.
S u g g e s t e d  C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s
A background contains suggested personal 
characteristics based on your background. You can 
pick characteristics, roll dice to determine 
them randomly, or use the suggestions 
as inspiration for characteristics of 
your own creation.
C u s t o m i z i n g  a  
B a c k g r o u n d  
You might want to tweak 
som e of the features of a 
background so it better 
fits your character 
or the campaign 
setting. To custom ize 
a background, you can 
replace one feature 
with any other one, 
choose any two 
skills, and choose 
a total of two tool 
proficiencies or 
languages from  the 
sample backgrounds. 
You can either use 
the equipment 
package from  your 
background or spend 
coin on gear as 
described in chapter 
5. (If you spend 
coin, you can’t also 
take the equipment 
package suggested 
for your class.)
Finally, choose 
two personality
traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find 
a feature that matches your desired background, work 
with your DM to create one.
A c o l y t e
You have spent your life in the service of a temple 
to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an 
intermediary between the realm of the holy and the 
mortal world, perform ing sacred rites and offering 
sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the 
presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a 
cleric-perform in g sacred rites is not the sam e thing as 
channeling divine power.
Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or som e other 
quasi-divine being from am ong those listed in appendix 
B or those specified by your DM, and work with your 
DM to detail the nature of your religious service.
W ere you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from 
childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or 
were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call 
to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were 
the leader of a small cult outside of any established 
temple structure, or even an occult group that served a 
fiendish master that you now deny.
Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Religion 
Languages: Two o f your choice 
Equipment: A holy sym bol (a gift to you when you 
entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer 
wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of com m on 
clothes, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp
F e a t u r e : S h e l t e r  o f  t h e  Fa i t h f u l
As an acolyte, you com m and the respect of those who 
share your faith, and you can perform  the religious 
cerem onies of your deity. You and your adventuring 
com panions can expect to receive free healing and 
care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence 
of your faith, though you must provide any material 
com ponents needed for spells. Those w ho share 
your religion will support you (but only you) at a 
m odest lifestyle.
You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated 
to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a 
residence there. This could be the temple where you 
used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a 
temple where you have found a new home. W hile near 
your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, 
provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and 
you remain in good standing with your temple.
S u g g e s t e d  C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s
Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples 
or other religious communities. Their study of the 
history and tenets of their faith and their relationships 
to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their 
m annerism s and ideals. Their flaws might be som e 
hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond 
taken to an extreme.

perfectly willing to use for your advantage.

Charlatans are colorful characters w ho conceal their 
true selves behind the masks they construct. They 
reflect what people want to see, what they want to

You are an experienced crim inal with a history of

You can always find a place to perform , usually in an 
inn or tavern but possibly with a circus, at a theater, or 
even in a noble’s court. At such a place, you receive free 
lodging and food of a m odest or com fortable standard 
(depending on the quality of the establishment), as 
long as you perform  each night. In addition, your 
perform ance m akes you som ething of a local figure. 
W hen strangers recognize you in a town where you have 
perform ed, they typically take a liking to you.

Successful entertainers have to be able to capture

have flamboyant or forceful personalities. They’re

As a m em ber of your guild, you know  the skills needed 
to create finished items from raw materials (reflected in 
your proficiency with a certain kind of artisan’s tools), 
as well as the principles o f trade and good business 
practices. The question now is whether you abandon 
your trade for adventure, or take on the extra effort to 
weave adventuring and trade together.
F e a t u r e : G u i l d  M e m b e r s h i p  
As an established and respected m em ber of a guild, you 
can rely on certain benefits that m em bership provides. 
Your fellow guild m em bers will provide you with 
lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral 
if needed. In som e cities and towns, a guildhall offers a 
central place to meet other m em bers of your profession, 
which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, 
allies, or hirelings.
Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If 
you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you 
if a good case can be made for your innocence or the 
crim e is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful 
political figures through the guild, if you are a member 
in good standing. Such connections might require the 
donation of money or m agic items to the guild’s coffers.
You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If 
you m iss payments, you must make up back dues to 
remain in the guild’s good graces.
Su g g e s t e d  C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s
Guild artisans are am ong the most ordinary people in 
the w orld—until they set down their tools and take up 
an adventuring career. They understand the value of  
hard work and the im portance of community, but they’re 
vulnerable to sins of greed and covetousness.
V a r i a n t  G u i l d  A r t i s a n : G u i l d  M e r c h a n t  
Instead of an artisans’ guild, you might belong to a 
guild of traders, caravan masters, or shopkeepers. You 
don’t craft items yourself but earn a living by buying 
and selling the works of others (or the raw materials 
artisans need to practice their craft). Your guild might 
be a large merchant consortium  (or family) with 
interests across the region. Perhaps you transported 
goods from one place to another, by ship, wagon, or 
caravan, or bought them from  traveling traders and sold 
them in your own little shop. In som e ways, the traveling 
merchant’s life lends itself to adventure far m ore than 
the life of an artisan.
Rather than proficiency with artisan’s tools, you might 
be proficient with navigator’s tools or an additional 
language. And instead of artisan’s tools, you can start 
with a mule and a cart.

You lived in seclusion—either in a sheltered community

F e a t u r e : D i s c o v e r y
The quiet seclusion of your extended hermitage gave you 
access to a unique and powerful discovery. The exact 
nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your 
seclusion. It might be a great truth about the cosm os, 
the deities, the powerful beings of the outer planes, or 
the forces of nature. It could be a site that no one else 
has ever seen. You might have uncovered a fact that has 
long been forgotten, or unearthed som e relic of the past 
that could rewrite history. It might be information that 
would be damaging to the people w ho or consigned you 
to exile, and hence the reason for your return to society.
W ork with your DM to determine the details of your 
discovery and its impact on the campaign.
S u g g e s t e d  C h a r a c t e r i s t i c s
Som e hermits are well suited to a life of seclusion,

This hermit background assum es a contemplative sort

the land while shunning the company of other people, 
look at the outlander background. On the other hand, if

might be what you’re looking for. Or you could even be a 
charlatan, posing as a w ise and holy person and letting 
pious fools support you.
N o b l e
You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You 
carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects 
taxes, and w ields significant political influence. You 
might be a pam pered aristocrat unfamiliar with

to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a 
disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be 
an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply 
about the people who live and w ork on your land, keenly 
aware of your responsibility to them.
W ork with your DM to com e up with an appropriate 
title and determine how much authority that title 
carries. A noble title doesn’t stand on its ow n—it’s 
connected to an entire family, and whatever title you 
hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not 
only do you need to determine your noble title, but you 
should also work with the DM to describe your family 
and their influence on you.
Is your family old and established, or w as your title 
only recently bestowed? H ow much influence do they 
wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation
does your family have am ong the other aristocrats of the 
region? H ow do the com m on people regard them?
W hat’s your position in the family? Are you the heir 
to the head of the family? Have you already inherited 
the title? H ow do you feel about that responsibility? Or 
are you so far down the line of inheritance that no one 
cares what you do, as long as you don’t embarrass the 
family? H ow  does the head of your family feel about 
your adventuring career? Are you in your family’s good 
graces, or shunned by the rest of your family?
D oes your family have a coat o f arms? An insignia you 
might w ear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear 
all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol of your 
line or even a spiritual m em ber of the family?
These details help establish your family and your title 
as features of the world of the campaign.

Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to 
think the best of you. You are w elcom e in high society, 
and people assume you have the right to be wherever 
you are. The com m on folk make every effort to 
accom m odate you and avoid your displeasure, and other 
people of high birth treat you as a mem ber of the same 
social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local 
noble if you need to.

Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle 
than most people ever experience, and their personalities 
reflect that upbringing. A noble title com es with a 
plethora of bonds—responsibilities to family, to other 
nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted 
to the fam ily’s care, or even to the title itself. But this 
responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble.

W hen you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you

from w hom  you can obtain it. Usually, this information 
com es from  a library, scriptorium, university, or a sage

a sailing ship for yourself and your adventuring

or another ship you have good relations with (perhaps 
one captained by a former crewmate). Because you’re 
calling in a favor, you can’t be certain of a schedule or 
route that will meet your every need. Your Dungeon 
Master will determine how  long it takes to get where 
you need to go. In return for your free passage, you

during the voyage.

Members of the nobility trade either in legal rights, such 
as the rights to a mine, a port, or farmland, or in gold 
bars, measuring gold by the pound rather than by the 
coin. Only merchants, adventurers, and those offering 
professional services for hire com m only deal in coins.
C o i n a g e  
Com m on coins com e in several different denominations 
based on the relative worth of the metal from which they 
are made. The three most com m on coins are the gold 
piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).
With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt 
pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but 
not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. 
The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for 
wealth, even if the coin itself is not com m only used. 
W hen merchants discuss deals that involve goods or 
services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, 
the transactions don’t usually involve the exchange of 
individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard 
m easure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold 
bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.
One gold piece is w orth ten silver pieces, the most 
prevalent coin among com m oners. A silver piece buys a 
laborer’s w ork for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night’s 
rest in a poor inn.
One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are 
com m on am ong laborers and beggars. A single copper 
piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.
In addition, unusual coins made of other precious 
metals som etim es appear in treasure hoards. The 
electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate 
from fallen empires and lost kingdom s, and they 
som etim es arouse suspicion and skepticism when used 
in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver 
pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.
A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, 
so fifty coins weigh a pound.

TH
E MARKETPLACE OF A LARGE CITY TEEMS
with buyers and sellers of many sorts: 
dwarf smiths and elf woodcarvers, halfling 
farmers and gnome jewelers, not to mention 
humans of every shape, size, and color 
drawn from a spectrum  of nations and 
cultures. In the largest cities, almost 
anything imaginable is offered for sale, from exotic 
spices and luxurious clothing to wicker baskets and 
practical swords.
For an adventurer, the availability of armor, weapons, 
backpacks, rope, and similar goods is of paramount 
im portance, since proper equipment can mean the 
difference between life and death in a dungeon or the 
untamed wilds. This chapter details the mundane and 
exotic merchandise that adventurers commonly find useful 
in the face of the threats that the worlds of D&D present.
St a r t in g  E q u ip m e n t
W hen you create your character, you receive equipment 
based on a combination of your class and background. 
Alternatively, you can start with a num ber of gold pieces 
based on your class and spend them on items from the 
lists in this chapter. See the Starting Wealth by Class 
table to determine how much gold you have to spend.
You decide how  your character cam e by this starting 
equipment. It might have been an inheritance, or goods 
that the character purchased during his or her upbringing. 
You might have been equipped with a weapon, armor, and 
a backpack as part of military service. You might even have 
stolen your gear. A w eapon could be a family heirloom, 
passed down from  generation to generation until your 
character finally took up the mantle and followed in an 
ancestor’s adventurous footsteps.
W e a l t h
Wealth appears in many forms in a D&D world. Coins, 
gemstones, trade goods, art objects, animals, and 
property can reflect your character’s financial well-being. 
Members of the peasantry trade in goods, bartering for 
what they need and paying taxes in grain and cheese.

S e l l i n g  T r e a s u r e  
Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, 
weapons, armor, and m ore in the dungeons you explore. 
Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when 
you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you 
can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.
Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment. As a general 
rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment 
fetch half their cost when sold in a market. W eapons 
and armor used by m onsters are rarely in good enough 
condition to sell.
Magic Items. Selling m agic items is problematic. 
Finding som eone to buy a potion or a scroll isn’t too 
hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but the 
wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside from a few com m on 
magic items, you w on’t normally com e across magic 
items or spells to purchase. The value of magic is far 
beyond simple gold and should always be treated as such.
Gems, 
Jewelry, and Art Objects. These items retain 
their full value in the marketplace, and you can either 
trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other 
transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the 
DM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or 
larger community first.
Trade Goods. On the borderlands, many people 
conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art 
objects, trade goods—bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock, 
and so on—retain their full value in the market and can 
be used as currency.
A r m o r a n d  Sh ie l d s
D&D worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many 
different cultures, each with its own technology level.
For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety 
of armor types, ranging from  leather armor to chain 
mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of 
armor in between. The Arm or table collects the most 
com m only available types of armor found in the game 
and separates them into three categories: light armor, 
medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors 
supplement their armor with a shield.
V a r i a n t : E q u i p m e n t  S i z e s
In most campaigns, you can use or wear any equipment that 
you find on your adventures, within the bounds of common 
sense. For example, a burly half-orc won't fit in a halfling’s 
leather armor, and a gnome would be swallowed up in a
 
cloud giant’s elegant robe.
The DM can impose more realism. For example, a suit of 
plate armor made for one human might not fit another one 
without significant alterations, and a guard’s uniform might 
be visibly ill-fitting when an adventurer tries to wear it as a
 
disguise.
Using this variant, when adventurers find armor, clothing, 
and similar items that are made to be worn, they might need 
to visit an armorsmith, tailor, leatherworker, or similar expert 
to make the item wearable. The cost for such work varies 
from 10 to 40 percent of 
the market price of the item. The 
DM can either roll 1
d4 x 10 or determine the increase in cost 
based on the extent of the alterations required.
The Arm or table shows the cost, weight, and other 
properties of the com m on types of armor worn in the 
worlds of D&D.
Armor Proficiency. Anyone can put on a suit o f armor 
or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the 
arm or’s use know how to w ear it effectively, however. 
Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of 
armor. If you w ear armor that you lack proficiency with, 
you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving 
throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, 
and you can’t cast spells.
Armor Class (AC). Arm or protects its w earer from 
attacks. The armor (and shield) you w ear determines 
your base Arm or Class.
Heavy 
Armor. Heavier armor interferes with the 
w earer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely.
If the Arm or table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the 
Strength colum n for an armor type, the armor reduces 
the w earer’s speed by 10 feet unless the w earer has a 
Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.
Stealth. If the Arm or table shows “Disadvantage” in 
the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on 
Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
Shields. A shield is made from  w ood or metal and 
is carried in one hand. W ielding a shield increases 
your Arm or Class by 2. You can benefit from  only one 
shield at a time.
L i g h t  A r m o r
Made from  supple and thin materials, light arm or favors 
agile adventurers since it offers som e protection without 
sacrificing mobility. If you w ear light armor, you add 
your Dexterity m odifier to the base number from your 
armor type to determine your Arm or Class.
Padded. Padded armor consists of quilted layers of 
cloth and batting.
Leather. The breastplate and shoulder protectors of 
this arm or are made of leather that has been stiffened 
by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of 
softer and m ore flexible materials.
Studded Leather. Made from tough but flexible 
leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set 
rivets or spikes.
M e d i u m  A r m o r
Medium armor offers m ore protection than light armor, 
but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium 
armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum 
of +2, to the base number from your armor type to 
determine your Arm or Class.
Hide. This crude arm or consists o f thick furs and 
pelts. It is com m only worn by barbarian tribes, evil 
humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools 
and materials needed to create better armor.
Chain Shirt. Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain 
shirt is worn between layers o f clothing or leather. This 
armor offers m odest protection to the wearer’s upper 
body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against 
one another to be muffled by outer layers.
Scale Mail. This armor consists of a coat and leggings 
(and perhaps a separate skirt) o f leather covered with

overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a 
fish. The suit includes gauntlets.
Breastplate. This armor consists of a fitted metal 
chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves 
the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor 
provides good protection for the w earer’s vital organs 
while leaving the w earer relatively unencumbered.
H alf 
Plate. Half plate consists of shaped metal plates 
that cover m ost of the wearer’s body. It does not include 
leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached 
with leather straps.
H e a v y  A r m o r
Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best 
protection. These suits o f armor cover the entire body 
and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only 
proficient w arriors can manage their weight and bulk.
Heavy armor doesn’t let you add your Dexterity 
modifier to your Arm or Class, but it also doesn’t 
penalize you if your Dexterity m odifier is negative.
Ring Mail. This armor is leather armor with heavy 
rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor 
against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is 
inferior to chain mail, and it's usually worn only by those 
w ho can’t afford better armor.
Chain Mail. Made of interlocking metal rings, chain 
mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath 
the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of 
blows. The suit includes gauntlets.
Splint. This armor is made of narrow vertical strips 
of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over 
cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints.
Plate. Plate consists o f shaped, interlocking metal 
plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes 
gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and 
thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles 
and straps distribute the weight over the body.

The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the 
arm or’s category.
Don. This is the time it takes to put on armor. You 
benefit from the armor's AC only if you take the full time 
to don the suit of armor.
Doff. This is the time it takes to take off armor. If you 
have help, reduce this time by half.
W e a p o n s
W e a p o n  P r o f i c i e n c y
Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency 
with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two 
categories are simple and martial. Most people can 
use simple w eapons with proficiency. These weapons 
include clubs, m aces, and other w eapons often found in 
the hands of com m oners. Martial w eapons, including 
swords, axes, and polearm s, require m ore specialized 
training to use effectively. M ost warriors use martial 
w eapons because these w eapons put their fighting style 
and training to best use.
Proficiency with a w eapon allows you to add your 
proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you 
make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using 
a w eapon with w hich you lack proficiency, you do not 
add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.
W e a p o n  P r o p e r t i e s
Many weapons have special properties related to their use, 
as shown in the W eapons table.
Ammunition. You can use a weapon that has the 
ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if 
you have ammunition to fire from  the weapon. Each 
time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece 
of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, 
case, or other container is part of the attack. At the 
end of the battle, you can recover half your expended 
ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, 
reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are 
most likely to use. W hether you favor a longsword or 
a longbow, your w eapon and your ability to wield it 
effectively can m ean the difference between life and 
death while adventuring.
The W eapons table shows the most com m on weapons 
used in the worlds of D&D, their price and weight, 
the damage they deal when they hit, and any special 
properties they possess. Every weapon is classified 
as either melee or ranged. A melee weapon is used to 
attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a ranged 
weapon is used to attack a target at a distance.
If 
you use a weapon that has the ammunition property 
to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an 
improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons" later in 
the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage 
when used in this way.
Finesse. When making an attack with a finesse 
weapon, you use your choice o f your Strength or 
Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You 
must use the same m odifier for both rolls.
Heavy. Sm all creatures have disadvantage on attack 
rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy w eapon’s size and 
bulk make it too large for a Sm all creature to use 
effectively.
Light. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, 
making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. 
See the rules for two-weapon fighting in chapter 9.
Loading. Because of the time required to load this 
weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition 
from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction 
to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can 
normally make.
Range. A weapon that can be used to make a ranged 
attack has a range shown in parentheses after the 
ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two 
numbers. The first is the w eapon’s normal range in feet, 
and the second indicates the w eapon’s maximum range. 
W hen attacking a target beyond normal range, you have 
disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target 
beyond the w eapon’s long range.
Reach. This w eapon adds 5 feet to your reach when 
you attack with it.
Special. A w eapon with the special property has 
unusual rules governing its use, explained in the 
w eapon’s description (see "Special W eapons" later in 
this section).
Thrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you 
can throw the w eapon to make a ranged attack. If the 
weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability 
m odifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you 
would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For 
example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, 
but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your 
Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the 
finesse property.
Two-Handed. This w eapon requires two hands to use.
Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two 
hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the 
property—the damage when the weapon is used with 
two hands to make a melee attack.
I m p r o v i s e d  W e a p o n s
Som etim es characters don’t have their w eapons and 
have to attack with whatever is close at hand. An 
im provised weapon includes any object you can wield 
in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a 
frying pan, a w agon wheel, or a dead goblin.
In many cases, an im provised weapon is similar 
to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For 
example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the DM ’s option, 
a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar 
object as if it w ere that weapon and use his or her 
proficiency bonus.
An object that bears no resem blance to a weapon 
deals 1d4 damage (the DM assigns a damage type 
appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged 
weapon to make a m elee attack, or throws a melee 
weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also 
deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a 
normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.
S i l v e r e d  W e a p o n s
Som e m onsters that have immunity or resistance 
to nonm agical w eapons are susceptible to silver 
weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to 
plate their w eapons with silver. You can silver a single 
weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This 
cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the 
time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon 
without making it less effective.
S p e c i a l  W e a p o n s
W eapons with special rules are described here.
Lance. You have disadvantage when you use a lance 
to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance 
requires two hands to wield when you aren’t mounted.
Net. A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is 
restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on
creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge 
or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 
Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within 
its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the 
net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, 
ending the effect and destroying the net.
W hen you use an action, bonus action, or reaction 
to attack with a net, you can make only one attack 
regardless of the number of attacks you can 
normally make.
A d v e n t u r i n g  G e a r
This section describes items that have special rules or 
require further explanation.
Acid. As an action, you can splash the contents of 
this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw 
the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either 
case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, 
treating the acid as an im provised weapon. On a hit, the 
target takes 2d6 acid damage.
Alchemist’s Fire. This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites 
when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this 
flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a 
ranged attack against a creature or object, treating

the alchemist's fire as an im provised weapon. On a 
hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of 
each of its turns. A creature can end this dam age by 
using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to 
extinguish the flames.
Antitoxin. A creature that drinks this vial of liquid 
gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 
hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.
Arcane Focus. An arcane focus is a special item— 
an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, 
a wand-like length of w ood, or som e similar item— 
designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A 
sorcerer, warlock, or w izard can use such an item as a 
spellcasting focus, as described in chapter 10.
Ball Bearings. A s an action, you can spill these tiny 
metal balls from  their pouch to cover a level area 10 
feet square. A creature moving across the covered area 
must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall 
prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed 
doesn’t need to make the saving throw.
Block and Tackle. A set of pulleys with a cable 
threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a 
block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the 
weight you can normally lift.
Book. A book might contain poetry, historical 
accounts, information pertaining to a particular field 
of lore, diagrams and notes on gnom ish contraptions, 
or just about anything else that can be represented 
using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook 
(described later in this section).
Caltrops. As an action, you can spread a single bag 
of caltrops to cover a 5-foot-square area. Any creature 
that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity 
saving throw or stop moving and take 1 piercing 
damage. Until the creature regains at least 1 hit point, 
its walking speed is reduced by 10 feet. A creature 
moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to 
make the saving throw.
Candle. For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 
5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
Case, Crossbow Bolt. This w ooden case can hold up 
to twenty crossbow  bolts.
Case, Map or Scroll. This cylindrical leather case can 
hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up 
sheets of parchment.
Chain. A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a 
successful DC 20 Strength check.
Climber’s Kit. A clim ber’s kit includes special pitons, 
boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the 
clim ber’s kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you 
do, you can’t fall m ore than 25 feet from the point where 
you anchored yourself, and you can't climb m ore than 25 
feet away from that point without undoing the anchor.
Component Pouch. A com ponent pouch is a small, 
watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments 
to hold all the material com ponents and other special 
items you need to cast your spells, except for those 
com ponents that have a specific cost (as indicated in a 
spell's description).
Crowbar. Using a crowbar grants advantage 
to Strength checks where the crowbar’s leverage 
can be applied.
Druidic Focus. A druidic focus might be a sprig of 
mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or 
another special w ood, a staff drawn whole out of a living 
tree, or a totem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, 
and teeth from  sacred animals. A druid can use such an 
object as a spellcasting focus, as described in chapter 10.
Fishing Tackle. This kit includes a w ooden rod, silken 
line, corkw ood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet 
lures, and narrow netting.
Healer’s Kit. This kit is a leather pouch containing 
bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As 
an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize 
a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make 
a W isdom  (M edicine) check.
Holy Symbol. A holy symbol is a representation of 
a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a 
sym bol representing a deity, the sam e symbol carefully 
engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny 
box holding a fragment o f a sacred relic. Appendix B 
lists the sym bols com m only associated with many gods 
in the multiverse. A  cleric or paladin can use a holy 
sym bol as a spellcasting focus, as described in chapter
10. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it 
in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield.
Holy Water. As an action, you can splash the contents 
of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw 
it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, 
make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating 
the holy water as an im provised weapon. If the target is 
a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage.
E q u i p m e n t  Pa c k s
The starting equipment you get from your class includes a
 
collection of useful adventuring gear, put together in a pack. 
The contents of these packs are listed here. If 
you are buying 
your starting equipment, you can purchase a pack for the 
price shown, which might be cheaper than buying the items 
individually.
Burglar’s Pack (16 gp). Includes a backpack, a bag of 1,000 
ball bearings, 10 feet of string, a bell, 5 candles, a crowbar, a 
hammer, 10 pitons, a hooded lantern, 2 flasks of oil, 5 days 
rations, a tinderbox, and a waterskin. The pack also has 50 
feet of hempen rope strapped to the side of it.
Diplomat's Pack (39 gp). Includes a chest, 2 cases for maps 
and scrolls, a set of fine clothes, a bottle of ink, an ink pen, 
a lamp, 2 flasks of oil, 5 sheets of paper, a vial of perfume, 
sealing wax, and soap.
Dungeoneer’s Pack (12 gp). Includes a backpack, a crowbar, 
a hammer, 10 pitons, 10 torches, a tinderbox, 10 days 
of rations, and a waterskin. The pack also has 50 feet of 
hempen rope strapped to the side of it.
Entertainer’s Pack (40 gp). Includes a backpack, a bedroll,
2 costumes, 5 candles, 5 days of rations, a waterskin, and a 
disguise kit.
Explorer’s Pack (10 gp). Includes a backpack, a bedroll, 
a mess kit, a tinderbox, 10 torches, 10 days of rations, and 
a waterskin. The pack also has 50 feet of hempen rope 
strapped to the side of it.
Priest’s Pack (19 gp). Includes a backpack, a blanket, 10 
candles, a tinderbox, an alms box, 2 blocks of incense, a 
censer, vestments, 2 days of rations, and a waterskin.
Scholar’s Pack (40 gp). Includes a backpack, a book of lore, 
a bottle of ink, an ink pen, 10 sheets of parchment, a little 
bag of sand, and a small knife.
A cleric or paladin may create holy water by 
perform ing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour 
to perform , uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and 
requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.
Hunting Trap. W hen you use your action to set it, 
this trap form s a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut 
when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. 
The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an im mobile 
object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. 
A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 
13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage 
and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks 
free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length 
of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use 
its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing 
itself or another creature within its reach on a success. 
Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the 
trapped creature.
Lamp. A lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius 
and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns 
for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.
Lantern, Bullseye. A bullseye lantern casts bright 
light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 
feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.
Lantern, Hooded. A hooded lantern casts bright light 
in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 
feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of 
oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the 
light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.
Lock. A key is provided with the lock. Without the 
key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick 
this lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.
Your DM may decide that better locks are available 
for higher prices.
Magnifying Glass. This lens allows a closer look at 
small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint 
and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a 
magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to 
focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire 
to ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any 
ability check made to appraise or inspect an item that is 
small or highly detailed.
Manacles. These metal restraints can bind a Small 
or Medium creature. Escaping the m anacles requires 
a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them 
requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each 
set of manacles com es with one key. Without the key, 
a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick the 
m anacles’ lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity 
check. Manacles have 15 hit points.
Mess Kit. This tin box contains a cup and simple 
cutlery. The box clam ps together, and one side can 
be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or 
shallow bowl.
Oil. Oil usually com es in a clay flask that holds 1 
pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask 
onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 
20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack 
against a target creature or object, treating the oil as 
an im provised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered 
in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil 
dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 
fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a 
flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, 
provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 
2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that 
enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature 
can take this damage only once per turn.
Spyglass. Objects viewed through a spyglass are 
magnified to twice their size.
Tent. A simple and portable canvas shelter, a 
tent sleeps two.
Tinderbox. This small container holds flint, fire steel, 
and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to 
kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch—or anything else 
with abundant, exposed fuel—takes an action. Lighting 
any other fire takes 1 minute.
Torch. A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light 
in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 
feet. If you make a m elee attack with a burning torch 
and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.
Poison, Basic. You can use the poison in this vial 
to coat one slashing or piercing w eapon or up to three 
pieces o f ammunition. Applying the poison takes 
an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or 
ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving 
throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the 
poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.
Potion of 
Healing. A character w ho drinks the magical 
red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking 
or administering a potion takes an action.
Pouch. A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 
sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, am ong other 
things. A compartm entalized pouch for holding spell 
com ponents is called a com ponent pouch (described 
earlier in this section).
Quiver. A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows.
Ram, Portable. You can use a portable ram to break 
down doors. W hen doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the 
Strength check. One other character can help you use 
the ram, giving you advantage on this check.
Rations. Rations consist of dry foods suitable 
for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, 
hardtack, and nuts.
Rope. Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit 
points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.
Scale, Merchant’s. A scale includes a small balance, 
pans, and a suitable assortm ent of weights up to 2 
pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight of 
small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade 
goods, to help determine their worth.
Spellbook. Essential for wizards, a spellbook is 
a leather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages 
suitable for recording spells.

T o o l s
A  tool helps you to do som ething you couldn't otherwise 
do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or 
pick a lock. Your race, class, background, or feats give 
you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool 
allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability 
check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to 
a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents 
broader knowledge of its use. For example, the DM 
might ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine 
detail with your w oodcarver’s tools, or a Strength check 
to make som ething out of particularly hard w ood.

Artisan’s Tools. These special tools include the items 
needed to pursue a craft or trade. The table shows 
examples of the m ost com m on types o f tools, each 
providing items related to a single craft. Proficiency 
with a set of artisan’s tools lets you add your proficiency 
bonus to any ability checks you make using the tools 
in your craft. Each type of artisan’s tools requires a 
separate proficiency.
Disguise Kit. This pouch of cosm etics, hair dye, and 
small props lets you create disguises that change your 
physical appearance. Proficiency with this kit lets you 
add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you 
make to create a visual disguise.
Forgery 
Kit. This sm all box contains a variety of 
papers and parchments, pens and inks, seals and 
sealing wax, gold and silver leaf, and other supplies

docum ents. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your 
proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to 
create a physical forgery of a document.
Gaming Set. This item encom passes a wide range 
of game pieces, including dice and decks of cards (for 
games such as Three-Dragon Ante). A  few com m on 
examples appear on the Tools table, but other kinds of 
gaming sets exist. If you are proficient with a gaming 
set, you can add your proficiency bonus to ability checks 
you make to play a game with that set. Each type of 
gaming set requires a separate proficiency.
Herbalism Kit. This kit contains a variety of 
instruments such as clippers, mortar and pestle, and 
pouches and vials used by herbalists to create rem edies 
and potions. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your 
proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to 
identify or apply herbs. Also, proficiency with this kit is 
required to create antitoxin and potions of 
healing.
Musical Instrument. Several of the most com m on 
types of musical instruments are shown on the table as 
examples. If you have proficiency with a given musical 
instrument, you can add your proficiency bonus to 
any ability checks you make to play music with the 
instrument. A bard can use a musical instrument as a 
spellcasting focus, as described in chapter 10. Each type 
of musical instrument requires a separate proficiency.
Navigator’s Tools. This set of instruments is used 
for navigation at sea. Proficiency with navigator's tools 
lets you chart a ship's course and follow navigation 
charts. In addition, these tools allow you to add your 
proficiency bonus to any ability check you make to avoid 
getting lost at sea.

disarm traps or open locks.
M o u n t s  a n d  V e h ic l e s
A  good mount can help you move m ore quickly through 
the w ilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the 
gear that w ould otherwise slow  you down. The Mounts 
and Other Anim als table shows each animal’s speed and 
base carrying capacity.
An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, 
or wagon can move weight up to five times its base 
carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle.
If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add 
their carrying capacity together.
Mounts other than those listed here are available in 
the worlds of D&D, but they are rare and not normally 
available for purchase. These include flying mounts 
(pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar animals) and 
even aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example). 
Acquiring such a mount often means securing an egg 
and raising the creature yourself, making a bargain with 
a powerful entity, or negotiating with the mount itself.
Barding. Barding is arm or designed to protect an 
anim al’s head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of 
arm or shown on the Arm or table in this chapter can 
be purchased as barding. The cost is four times the 
equivalent armor made for humanoids, and it weighs 
tw ice as much.
Saddles. A military saddle braces the rider, helping 
you keep your seat on an active mount in battle. It 
gives you advantage on any check you make to remain 
mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding any 
aquatic or flying mount.
Vehicle Proficiency. If you have proficiency with a 
certain kind of vehicle (land or water), you can add your 
proficiency bonus to any check you make to control that 
kind of vehicle in difficult circum stances.
Rowed Vessels. Keelboats and rowboats are used on 
lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of 
the current (typically 3 m iles per hour) to the speed of
the vehicle. These vehicles can’t be rowed against any

Most wealth is not in coins. It is m easured in livestock, 
grain, land, rights to collect taxes, or rights to resources 
(such as a mine or a forest).
Guilds, nobles, and royalty regulate trade. Chartered 
com panies are granted rights to conduct trade along 
certain routes, to send merchant ships to various ports, 
or to buy or sell specific goods. Guilds set prices for 
the goods or services that they control, and determine 
who may or may not offer those goods and services. 
Merchants com m only exchange trade goods without 
using currency. The Trade G oods table shows the value 
of com m only exchanged goods.

W hen not descending into the depths of the earth, 
exploring ruins for lost treasures, or waging war against 
the encroaching darkness, adventurers face m ore 
mundane realities. Even in a fantastical world, people 
require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, 
and clothing. These things cost money, although som e 
lifestyles cost m ore than others.
L i f e s t y l e  E x p e n s e s
Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to 
account for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They 
cover your accom m odations, food and drink, and all 
your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the 
cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready 
when adventure next calls.
At the start of each w eek or month (your choice), 
choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the 
price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per 
day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen 
lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price 
by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to 
the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, 
or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout 
your character’s career.
Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. 
Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make 
contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the 
risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might 
help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make 
powerful connections.

Wretched. You live in inhumane conditions. With 
no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, 
sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying 
on the good graces of people better off than you. A 
wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, 
disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other 
wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and 
adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their 
standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.
Squalid. You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut 
just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house 
in the worst part of town. You have shelter from  the 
elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent 
environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and 
misfortune. You are beneath the notice of m ost people, 
and you have few legal protections. Most people at 
this lifestyle level have suffered som e terrible setback. 
They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer 
from  disease.
Poor. A poor lifestyle means going without the 
com forts available in a stable community. Simple food 
and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable 
conditions result in a sufficient, though probably 
unpleasant, experience. Your accom m odations might 
be a room  in a flophouse or in the com m on room  above 
a tavern. You benefit from som e legal protections, 
but you still have to contend with violence, crime, 
and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be 
unskilled laborers, costerm ongers, peddlers, thieves, 
mercenaries, and other disreputable types.
Modest. A m odest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums 
and ensures that you can maintain your equipment.
You live in an older part of town, renting a room  in a 
boarding house, inn, or temple. You don't go hungry or 
thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. 
Ordinary people living m odest lifestyles include soldiers 
with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, 
and the like.
Comfortable. Choosing a com fortable lifestyle 
means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily 
maintain your equipment. You live in a small cottage 
in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room  
at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled 
tradespeople, and military officers.
Wealthy. Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a 
life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the 
social status associated with the old money of nobility 
or royalty. You live a lifestyle com parable to that of a 
highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the 
royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You 
have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious hom e in 
a good part of town or a com fortable suite at a fine inn. 
You likely have a small staff of servants.
Aristocratic. You live a life of plenty and comfort. You 
move in circles populated by the m ost powerful people 
in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps 
a townhouse in the nicest part of town or room s in the 
finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the 
most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants 
attending to your every need. You receive invitations 
to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and 
spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild 
leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also 
contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. 
The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will 
be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.

S e l f - S u f f i c i e n c y
The expenses and lifestyles described in this chapter assume 
that you are spending your time between adventures in town, 
availing yourself of whatever services you can afford— paying 
for food and shelter, paying townspeople to sharpen your 
sword and repair your armor, and so on. Some characters, 
though, might prefer to spend their time away from 
civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, 
foraging, and repairing their own gear.
Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn’t require you to 
spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend 
your time between adventures practicing a profession, as 
described in chapter 8, you can eke out the equivalent of a 
poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at 
the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.
S e r v i c e s
Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them 
or act on their behalf in a variety o f circum stances. Most 
such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others 
are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with 
specialized adventuring skills.
S om e of the most basic types of hirelings appear on 
the Services table. Other com m on hirelings include 
any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical 
town or city, when the adventurers pay them to 
perform  a specific task. For example, a wizard might 
pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and 
its miniature replica) for use in the Leomund’s secret 
chest spell. A fighter might com m ission a blacksmith to 
forge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make 
exquisite clothing for an upcom ing perform ance in 
front of the duke.
Other hirelings provide m ore expert or dangerous 
services. M ercenary soldiers paid to help the 
adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as 
are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a 
high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of som e 
kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and 
agents to run the place, from  a castellan or steward 
to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These 
hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes 
a place to live within the stronghold as part of the 
offered compensation.

Skilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform  a 
service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, 
tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. 
The pay shown is a minimum; som e expert hirelings 
require m ore pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for 
menial work that requires no particular skill and can 
include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.
S p e l l c a s t i n g  S e r v i c e s  
People w ho are able to cast spells don’t fall into the 
category of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to 
find som eone w illing to cast a spell in exchange for coin 
or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay 
rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired 
spell, the harder it is to find som eone who can cast it 
and the m ore it costs.
Hiring som eone to cast a relatively com m on spell 
of 1st or 2nd level, such as cure wounds or identify, is 
easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 
gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material 
components). Finding som eone able and willing to 
cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a 
large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent 
temple. Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a 
service instead of payment—the kind of service that 
only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare 
item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster- 
infested wilderness to deliver som ething important to 
a distant settlement.

W hen you make your character, you can roll once on 
the Trinkets table to gain a trinket, a simple item lightly

It can help stock a room  in a dungeon or fill a creature’s 
pockets.

C h a p t e r  6: C u s t o m i z a t i o n  O p t i o n s
T
HE COMBINATION OF ABILITY SCORES, RACE,
class, and background defines your 
character’s capabilities in the game, and 
the personal details you create set your 
character apart from every other character. 
Even within your class and race, you have 
options to fine-tune what your character 
can do. But this chapter is for players w ho—with the 
DM ’s perm ission—want to go a step further.
This chapter defines two optional sets of rules for 
customizing your character: multiclassing and feats. 
Multiclassing lets you com bine classes together, 
and feats are special options you can choose instead 
of increasing your ability scores as you gain levels.
Your DM decides whether these options are available 
in a campaign.
M u l t ic l a s s in g
Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple 
classes. Doing so lets you m ix the abilities of those 
classes to realize a character concept that might not be 
reflected in one of the standard class options.
With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level 
in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead 
of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in 
all your classes are added together to determine your 
character level. For example, if you have three levels in 
wizard and two in fighter, you’re a 5th-level character.
As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain 
a m em ber of your original class with just a few levels 
in another class, or you might change course entirely, 
never looking back at the class you left behind. You 
might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. 
Com pared to a single-class character of the sam e level, 
you’ll sacrifice som e focus in exchange for versatility.
M u l t i c l a s s i n g  E x a m p l e
Gary is playing a 4th-level fighter. When his character earns 
enough experience points to reach 5th level, Gary decides 
that his character will multiclass instead of continuing to 
progress as a fighter. Gary’s fighter has been spending a lot 
of 
time with Dave’s rogue, and has even been doing some 
jobs on the side for the local thieves’ guild as a bruiser. Gary 
decides that his character will multiclass into the rogue class, 
and thus his character becomes a 4th-level fighter and 1st- 
level rogue (written as fighter 4/rogue 1).
When Gary’s character earns enough experience to 
reach 6th level, he can decide whether to add another 
fighter level (becoming a fighter 5/rogue 1), another rogue 
level (becoming a fighter 4/rogue 2), or a level in a third 
class, perhaps dabbling in wizardry thanks to the tome of 
mysterious lore he acquired (becoming a fighter 4/rogue 1/ 
wizard 1).
P r e r e q u i s i t e s  
To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score 
prerequisites for both your current class and your new 
one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. 
For example, a barbarian w ho decides to multiclass into 
the druid class must have both Strength and W isdom  
scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that 
a beginning character receives, you must be a quick 
study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that 
is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.

E x p e r i e n c e  P o i n t s
The experience point cost to gain a level is always 
based on your total character level, as shown in the 
Character Advancement table in chapter 1, not your level 
in a particular class. So, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1, 
you must gain enough X P  to reach 8th level before you 
can take your second level as a fighter or your seventh 
level as a cleric.
H i t  P o i n t s  a n d  H i t  D i c e
You gain the hit points from your new class as described 
for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a 
class only when you are a 1st-level character.
You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your 
classes to form  your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are 
the same die type, you can simply pool them together. 
For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a 
d 10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d 10 
Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice o f different 
types, keep track of them separately. If you are a paladin 
5/cleric 5, for example, you have five d 10 Hit Dice and 
five d8 Hit Dice.
P r o f i c i e n c y  B o n u s
Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total 
character level, as shown in the Character Advancement 
table in chapter 1, not your level in a particular class.
For example, if you are a fighter 3/rogue 2, you have the 
proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3.
P r o f i c i e n c i e s
W hen you gain a level in a class other than your first, 
you gain only som e of that class’s starting proficiencies, 
as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.
C l a s s  F e a t u r e s
W hen you gain a new level in a class, you get its features 
for that level. A few features, however, have additional 
rules when you’re multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra 
Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.
C h a n n e l  D i v i n i t y
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain 
a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the 
Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting 
the feature again doesn’t give you an additional use of 
it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class 
level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if 
you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity 
twice between rests because you are high enough level 
in the cleric class to have more uses. W henever you use 
the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity 
effects available to you from your two classes.
E x t r a  A t t a c k
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more 
than one class, the features don’t add together. You 
can’t make m ore than two attacks with this feature 
unless it says you do (as the fighter’s version of Extra 
Attack does). Similarly, the warlock’s eldritch invocation 
Thirsting Blade doesn’t give you additional attacks if you 
also have Extra Attack.
U n a r m o r e d  D e f e n s e
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you 
can’t gain it again from  another class.
S p e l l c a s t i n g
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your 
com bined levels in all your spellcasting classes and 
partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once 
you have the Spellcasting feature from m ore than one 
class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the 
Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the 
rules as described in that class.
Spells Known and Prepared. You determine 
what spells you know and can prepare for each class 
individually, as if you were a single-classed mem ber of 
that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, 
you know three 1st-level ranger spells based on your 
levels in the ranger class. As 3rd-level wizard, you know 
three w izard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten 
wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when 
you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level 
spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six 
wizard spells from your spellbook.
Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one 
of 
your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that 
class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting 
focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the 
spells from the class associated with that focus.
Spell Slots. You determine your available spell slots 
by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, 
druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels 
(rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and 
a third o f your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) 
if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster 
feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by 
consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.
If you have m ore than one spellcasting class, this table 
might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than 
the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those 
slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower- 
level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an 
enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you 
can use the enhanced effect, even though you don’t have 
any spells of that higher level.
For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/ 
wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when 
determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level 
slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. 
However, you don’t know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you 
know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell 
slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know—and 
potentially enhance their effects.
Pact Magic. If you have both the Spellcasting class 
feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock 
class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact 
Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared 
from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you 
can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting 
class feature to cast w arlock spells you know.

F e a t s
A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives 
a character special capabilities. It embodies training, 
experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.
At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score 
Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you 
can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice 
instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the 
feat’s description says otherwise.
You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat 
to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, 
you can’t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. 
For example, the Grappler feat requires you to have a 
Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced 
below  13 som ehow —perhaps by a withering curse— 
you can’t benefit from  the Grappler feat until your 
Strength is restored.

IX ABILITIES PROVIDE A QUICK DESCRIPTION
of every creature’s physical and mental 
characteristics:
•
 Strength, measuring physical power
•
 Dexterity, measuring agility
•
 Constitution, measuring endurance
•
 Intelligence, measuring reasoning 
and m em ory
•
 Wisdom, measuring perception and insight
•
 Charisma, measuring force of personality
Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant 
and charm ing? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores 
define these qualities—a creature’s assets as well 
as weaknesses.
The three main rolls of the gam e—the ability check, 
the saving throw, and the attack roll—rely on the six 
ability scores. The book’s introduction describes the 
basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability 
modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and 
com pare the total to a target number.
This chapter focuses on how to use ability checks 
and saving throws, covering the fundamental activities 
that creatures attempt in the game. Rules for attack rolls 
appear in chapter 9.
A b il i t y  Sc o r es a n d  
M o d ifie r s
Each of a creature’s abilities has a score, a number that 
defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score 
is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also 
encom passes a creature’s training and com petence in 
activities related to that ability.
A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but 
adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average 
in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a 
person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores 
as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have 
scores as high as 30.
Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the 
score and ranging from 5 (for an ability score of 1) to 
+10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and M odifiers 
table notes the ability m odifiers for the range of possible 
ability scores, from 1 to 30.

To determine an ability m odifier without consulting 
the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then 
divide the total by 2 (round down).
Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack 
roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers 
com e up in play m ore often than their associated scores.
A d v a n t a g e a n d  
D is a d v a n t a g e
Som etim es a special ability or spell tells you that you 
have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, 
a saving throw, or an attack roll. W hen that happens, 
you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the 
higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use 
the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if 
you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 
5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, 
you use the 17.
If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants 
advantage or im poses disadvantage on it, you don’t roll 
m ore than one additional d20. If two favorable situations 
grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one 
additional d20.
If circum stances cause a roll to have both advantage 
and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of 
them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple 
circum stances im pose disadvantage and only one grants 
advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have 
neither advantage nor disadvantage.
W hen you have advantage or disadvantage and 
som ething in the game, such as the halfling’s Lucky 
trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one 
of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a 
halfling has advantage on an ability check and rolls 
a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to 
reroll the 1.
You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through 
the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration 
(see chapter 4) can also give a character advantage on 
checks related to the character’s personality, ideals, 
or bonds. The DM can also decide that circum stances 
influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant 
advantage or im pose disadvantage as a result.
P r o f ic ie n c y  B o n u s
Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by 
level, as detailed in chapter 1. Monsters also have this 
bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The 
bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving 
throws, and attack rolls.
Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die 
roll or other number m ore than once. For example, if 
two different rules say you can add your proficiency 
bonus to a W isdom  saving throw, you nevertheless add 
the bonus only once when you make the save.
Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be 
multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example)
before you apply it. For example, the rogue's Expertise 
feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability 
checks. If a circum stance suggests that your proficiency 
bonus applies m ore than once to the sam e roll, you still 
add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.
By the sam e token, if a feature or effect allows you 
to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an 
ability check that w ouldn’t normally benefit from your 
proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to the 
check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given 
the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For 
instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, 
you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double 
your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence 
(History) checks.
In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus 
for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect 
allows you to do so, these same rules apply.
A b i l i t y  C h e c k s
An ability check tests a character’s or monster’s innate 
talent and training in an effort to overcom e a challenge. 
The DM calls for an ability check when a character or 
monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that 
has a chance of failure. W hen the outcom e is uncertain, 
the dice determine the results.
For every ability check, the DM decides which of the six 
abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty 
of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more 
difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty 
Classes table show s the most com m on DCs.
T y p i c a l  D i f f i c u l t y  C l a s s e s
Task Difficulty
DC
Very easy
5
Easy
10
Medium
15
Hard
20
Very hard
25
Nearly impossible
30
To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the 
relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply 
bonuses and penalties, and com pare the total to the DC. 
If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check 
is a success—the creature overcom es the challenge 
at hand. Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the 
character or monster makes no progress toward the 
objective or makes progress com bined with a setback 
determined by the DM.
C o n t e s t s _______________________________
Som etim es one character’s or monster’s efforts are 
directly opposed to another’s. This can occur when both 
of them are trying to do the sam e thing and only one 
can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic 
ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also 
applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other 
one from accom plishing a goal—for example, when a 
monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer
is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome 
is determined by a special form of ability check, 
called a contest.
Both participants in a contest make ability checks 
appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate 
bonuses and penalties, but instead o f com paring the 
total to a DC, they com pare the totals of their two 
checks. The participant with the higher check total wins 
the contest. That character or monster either succeeds 
at the action or prevents the other one from  succeeding.
If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the 
same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant 
might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in 
a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character 
grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open 
a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, 
a tie means that the door remains shut.
Sk i l l s
Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, 
including skills that a character or a monster can be 
proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an 
ability score, and an individual’s proficiency in a skill 
demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character’s 
starting skill proficiencies are determined at character  
creation, and a monster’s skill proficiencies appear in 
the monster’s stat block.)
For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a 
character’s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm 
an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of 
Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of 
Hand, and Stealth, respectively. S o a character w ho has 
proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at 
Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.
The skills related to each ability score are shown in 
the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) 
S ee an ability’s description in the later sections o f this 
chapter for examples of how to use a skill associated 
with an ability.
Som etim es, the DM might ask for an ability check 
using a specific skill—for example, “Make a W isdom  
(Perception) check.” At other times, a player might ask 
the DM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a 
check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an 
individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability 
checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the 
skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.

For example, if a character attempts to clim b up a

Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient 
in Athletics, the character’s proficiency bonus is added 
to the Strength check. If the character lacks that 
proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.
V a r i a n t : S k i l l s  w i t h  D i f f e r e n t  A b i l i t i e s
Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a 
specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, 
for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In som e 
situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably 
apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the DM 
might ask for a check using an unusual combination of 
ability and skill, or you might ask your DM if you can 
apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, 
if you have to swim from  an offshore island to the 
mainland, your DM might call for a Constitution check 
to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this 
case, your DM might allow you to apply your proficiency 
in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. 
S o if you’re proficient in Athletics, you apply your 
proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you 
would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. 
Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display 
of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your DM might 
ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though 
Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.
Pa s s iv e  C h e c k s
A passive check is a special kind of ability check that 
doesn’t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent 
the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as 
searching for secret doors over and over again, or can 
be used when the DM wants to secretly determine 
whether the characters succeed at som ething without 
rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.
Here’s how to determine a character’s total for a 
passive check:
10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check
If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For 
disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive 
check total as a score.
For example, if a 1st-level character has a W isdom  of 
15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive 
W isdom  (Perception) score of 14.
The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below 
rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules 
in chapter 8.
W o r k i n g  T o g e t h e r
Som etim es two or m ore characters team up to attempt a 
task. The character w ho’s leading the effort—or the one 
with the highest ability m odifier—can make an ability 
check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by 
the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help 
action (see chapter 9).
A  character can only provide help if the task is one that 
he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to 
open a lock requires proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a
character who lacks that proficiency can’t help another 
character in that task. Moreover, a character can help 
only when two or more individuals working together 
would actually be productive. Som e tasks, such as 
threading a needle, are no easier with help.
G r o u p  C h e c k s
W hen a number of individuals are trying to accom plish 
som ething as a group, the DM might ask for a group 
ability check. In such a situation, the characters w ho are 
skilled at a particular task help cover those w ho aren't.
To make a group ability check, everyone in the group 
m akes the ability check. If at least half the group 
succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, 
the group fails.
Group checks don’t com e up very often, and they’re 
most useful when all the characters succeed or 
fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are 
navigating a swamp, the DM might call for a group 
W isdom  (Survival) check to see if the characters can 
avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural 
hazards o f the environment. If at least half the group 
succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide 
their com panions out of danger. Otherwise, the group 
stumbles into one o f these hazards.
U s in g Ea c h  A b il i t y
Every task that a character or monster might attempt 
in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This 
section explains in m ore detail what those abilities 
mean and the ways they are used in the game.
St r e n g t h
Strength m easures bodily power, athletic training, and 
the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.
St r e n g t h  C h e c k s
A Strength check can m odel any attempt to lift, push, 
pull, or break something, to force your body through a 
space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. 
The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of 
Strength checks.
Athletics. Your Strength (Athletics) check covers 
difficult situations you encounter while climbing, 
jumping, or swimming. Examples include the 
following activities:
•
 You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid 
hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface 
while som ething is trying to knock you off.
•
 You try to jum p an unusually long distance or pull 
off a stunt midjump.
•
 You struggle to swim  or stay afloat in treacherous cur­
rents, storm -tossed waves, or areas o f thick seaweed. 
Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwa­
ter or otherwise interfere with your swimming.
Other Strength Checks. The DM might also call for 
a Strength check when you try to accom plish tasks like 
the following:
•
 Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door
•
 Break free of bonds
•
 Push through a tunnel that is too small
•
 Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it
•
 Tip over a statue
•
 Keep a boulder from  rolling
A t t a c k  R o l l s  a n d  D a m a g e
You add your Strength m odifier to your attack roll and 
your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon 
such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use 
melee w eapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand 
combat, and som e of them can be thrown to make a 
ranged attack.
L i f t i n g  a n d  C a r r y i n g
Your Strength score determines the amount of weight 
you can bear. The following terms define what you can 
lift or carry.
Carrying Capacity. Your carrying capacity is your 
Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in 
pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that 
most characters don’t usually have to worry about it.
Push, Drag, or Lift. You can push, drag, or lift a 
weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity 
(or 30 times your Strength score). W hile pushing or 
dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, 
your speed drops to 5 feet.
Size and Strength. Larger creatures can bear m ore 
weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For 
each size category above Medium, double the creature’s 
carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or 
lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.
Dexterity m easures agility, reflexes, and balance. 
D e x t e r i t y  C h e c k s
A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move 
nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling 
on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, 
and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of 
Dexterity checks.
Acrobatics. Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers 
your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, 
such as when you’re trying to run across a sheet o f ice, 
balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking 
ship’s deck. The DM might also call for a Dexterity 
(Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform  acrobatic 
stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.
V a r i a n t : E n c u m b r a n c e  
The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally 
simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for m ore 
detailed rules for determining how a character is 
hindered by the weight of equipment. W hen you use this 
variant, ignore the Strength colum n of the Arm or table 
in chapter 5.
If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength 
score, you are encumbered, which means your speed 
drops by 10 feet.
If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your 
Strength score, up to your m aximum carrying capacity, 
you are instead heavily encumbered, which means your 
speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on 
ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use 
Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.
D e x t e r i t y
Sleight of 
Hand. W henever you attempt an act of 
legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting 
som ething on som eone else or concealing an object on 
your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight o f Hand) check. 
The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) 
check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off 
another person or slip som ething out of another 
person’s pocket.
Stealth. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you 
attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past 
guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on 
som eone without being seen or heard.
Other Dexterity Checks. The DM might call for a 
Dexterity check when you try to accom plish tasks like 
the following:
•
 Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent
•
 Steer a chariot around a tight turn
•
 Pick a lock
•
 Disable a trap
•
 Securely tie up a prisoner
•
 W riggle free of bonds
•
 Play a stringed instrument
•
 Craft a small or detailed object
A t t a c k  R o l l s  a n d  D a m a g e
You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and 
your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, 
such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your 
Dexterity m odifier to your attack roll and your damage 
roll when attacking with a melee w eapon that has the 
finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.
H i d i n g
When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until 
you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check’s total is 
contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature 
that actively searches for signs of your presence.
You can’t hide from a creature that can see you, and if 
you 
make noise (such as shouting a warning or knocking over a 
vase), you give away your position. An invisible creature can’t 
be seen, so it can always try to hide. Signs of its passage 
might still be noticed, however, and it still has to stay quiet.
In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger 
all around, so if 
you come out of hiding and approach 
a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain 
circumstances, the Dungeon Master might allow you to stay 
hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing 
you to gain advantage on an attack before you are seen.
Passive Perception. When you hide, there’s a chance 
someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To 
determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM 
compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature’s 
passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the 
creature’s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses 
or penalties. If 
the creature has advantage, add 5. For 
disadvantage, subtract 5.
For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency 
bonus o f 
+2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and 
proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom 
(Perception) of 14.
What Can You See? One of the main factors in determining 
whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well 
you can see in an area, which might be lightly or heavily 
obscured, as explained in chapter 8.
A r m o r  G l a s s
Depending on the armor you wear, you might add som e 
or all of your Dexterity m odifier to your Arm or Class, 
as described in chapter 5.
I n i t i a t i v e
At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative 
by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines 
the order of creatures’ turns in combat, as described 
in chapter 9.
C o n s t i t u t i o n
Constitution m easures health, stamina, and vital force.
C o n s t i t u t i o n  C h e c k s
Constitution checks are uncom m on, and no skills apply 
to Constitution checks, because the endurance this 
ability represents is largely passive rather than involving 
a specific effort on the part of a character or monster.
A Constitution check can m odel your attempt to push 
beyond normal limits, however.
The DM might call for a Constitution check when you 
try to accom plish tasks like the following:
•
 Hold your breath
•
 March or labor for hours without rest
•
 Go without sleep
•
 Survive without food or water
•
 Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go
H i t  P o i n t s
Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit 
points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to 
each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.
If your Constitution m odifier changes, your hit point 
maximum changes as well, as though you had the new 
modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your 
Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your 
Constitution m odifier increases from  +1 to +2, you 
adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier 
had always been +2. S o you add 3 hit points for your 
first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th 
level using your new modifier. Or if you’re 7th level and 
som e effect lowers your Constitution score so as to 
reduce your Constitution m odifier by 1, your hit point 
maximum is reduced by 7.
I n t e l l i g e n c e
Intelligence m easures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, 
and the ability to reason.
I n t e l l i g e n c e  C h e c k s
An Intelligence check com es into play when you need 
to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive 
reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, 
and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of 
Intelligence checks.
Arcana. Your Intelligence (Arcana) check m easures 
your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, 
eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of 
existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.
History. Your Intelligence (History) check m easures 
your ability to recall lore about historical events,
legendary people, ancient kingdom s, past disputes, 
recent wars, and lost civilizations.
Investigation. W hen you look around for clues and 
make deductions based on those clues, you make an 
Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the 
location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance 
o f a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine 
the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to 
collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of 
a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an 
Intelligence (Investigation) check.
Nature. Your Intelligence (Nature) check m easures 
your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and 
animals, the weather, and natural cycles.
Religion. Your Intelligence (Religion) check m easures 
your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, 
religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices 
of secret cults.
Other Intelligence Checks. The DM might call for an 
Intelligence check when you try to accom plish tasks like 
the following:
•
 Communicate with a creature without using words
•
 Estimate the value of a precious item
•
 Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard
•
 Forge a docum ent
•
 Recall lore about a craft or trade
•
 W in a game of skill
S p e l l c a s t i n g  A b i l i t y
W izards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, 
which helps determine the saving throw DCs of 
spells they cast.
W i s d o m
W isdom  reflects how attuned you are to the world 
around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.
W i s d o m  C h e c k s
A W isdom  check might reflect an effort to read body 
language, understand som eone’s feelings, notice things 
about the environment, or care for an injured person. 
The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, 
and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of 
W isdom  checks.
Animal Handling. W hen there is any question 
whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, 
keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s 
intentions, the DM might call for a W isdom  (Animal 
Handling) check. You also make a W isdom  (Animal 
Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt 
a risky maneuver.
Insight. Your W isdom  (Insight) check decides whether 
you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such 
as w hen searching out a lie or predicting som eone’s 
next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body 
language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.
Medicine. A W isdom  (Medicine) check lets you try to 
stabilize a dying com panion or diagnose an illness.
Perception. Your W isdom  (Perception) check lets 
you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of 
something. It m easures your general awareness of 
your surroundings and the keenness of your senses.
F i n d i n g  a H i d d e n  O b j e c t
When your character searches for a hidden object such as 
a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a 
Wisdom (Perception) check. Such a check can be used to find 
hidden details or other information and clues that you might 
otherwise overlook.
In
 most cases, you need to describe where you are looking 
in order for the DM to determine your chance of success. For 
example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes in 
the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you pace 
around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues, 
you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of 
your 
Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to specify 
that you were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in 
order to have any chance of success.
For example, you might try to hear a conversation 
through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, 
or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you 
might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to 
miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, 
thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight 
under a closed secret door.
Survival. The DM might ask you to make a W isdom  
(Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide 
your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs 
that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid 
quicksand and other natural hazards.
Other Wisdom Checks. The DM might call for a 
W isdom  check when you try to accom plish tasks like 
the following:
•
 Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow
•
 Discern whether a seem ingly dead or living creature 
is undead
S p e l l c a s t i n g  A b i l i t y
Clerics, druids, and rangers use W isdom  as their 
spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving 
throw DCs of spells they cast.

Charisma m easures your ability to interact effectively 
with others. It includes such factors as confidence 
and eloquence, and it can represent a charm ing or 
com m anding personality.
C h a r i s m a  C h e c k s
A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence 
or entertain others, when you try to make an impression 
or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a 
tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, 
Perform ance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in 
certain kinds of Charisma checks.
Deception. Your Charisma (Deception) check 
determines whether you can convincingly hide the 
truth, either verbally or through your actions. This 
deception can encom pass everything from misleading 
others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical 
situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a 
merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself 
off in a disguise, dull som eone’s suspicions with false 
assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling 
a blatant lie.
Intimidation. W hen you attempt to influence som eone 
through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical 
violence, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma 
(Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry 
information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs 
to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of 
a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to 
reconsider a decision.
Performance. Your Charisma (Perform ance) check 
determines how well you can delight an audience with 
music, dance, acting, storytelling, or som e other form  of 
entertainment.
Persuasion. W hen you attempt to influence som eone 
or a group o f people with tact, social graces, or good 
nature, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma 
(Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when 
acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial 
requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of 
persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to 
let your party see the king, negotiating peace between 
warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.
Other Charisma Checks. The DM might call for a 
Charisma check when you try to accom plish tasks like 
the following:
•
 Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, 
and gossip
•
 Blend into a crowd to get the sense o f key topics 
o f conversation
S p e l l c a s t i n g  A b i l i t y
Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and w arlocks use Charisma 
as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the 
saving throw DCs of spells they cast.
Sa v in g  T h r o w s
A saving throw—also called a save—represents an 
attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or 
a similar threat. You don’t normally decide to make a 
saving throw; you are forced to make one because your 
character or monster is at risk of harm.
To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the 
appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your 
Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.
A saving throw can be modified by a situational 
bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage 
and disadvantage, as determined by the DM.
Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving 
throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient 
in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, 
proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his 
or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using 
a particular ability score. Som e monsters have saving 
throw proficiencies as well.
The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined 
by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a 
saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the 
caster’s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.
The result of a successful or failed saving throw is 
also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, 
a successful save m eans that a creature suffers no 
harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.
C h a p t e r  8: A d v e n t u r i n g
D
ELVING INTO THE ANCIENT TOMB OF HORRORS.
slipping through the back alleys of 
Waterdeep, hacking a fresh trail through 
the thick 
jungles on the Isle of Dread—these 
are the things that D u n g e o n s  &  D r a g o n s  
adventures are made of. Your character in 
the game might explore forgotten ruins and 
uncharted lands, uncover dark secrets and sinister 
plots, and slay foul monsters. And if all goes well, your 
character will survive to claim rich rewards before 
embarking on a new adventure.
This chapter covers the basics of the adventuring life, 
from the m echanics of movement to the complexities of 
social interaction. The rules for resting are also in this 
chapter, along with a discussion of the activities your 
character might pursue between adventures.
W hether adventurers are exploring a dusty dungeon 
or the com plex relationships of a royal court, the game 
follows a natural rhythm, as outlined in the book’s 
introduction:
1. The DM describes the environment.
2. The players describe what they want to do.
3. The DM narrates the results of their actions.
Typically, the DM uses a map as an outline of the 
adventure, tracking the characters’ progress as they 
explore dungeon corridors or wilderness regions.
The DM ’s notes, including a key to the map, describe 
what the adventurers find as they enter each new area. 
Som etim es, the passage of time and the adventurers’ 
actions determine what happens, so the DM might 
use a timeline or a flowchart to track their progress 
instead of a map.
T im e
In situations where keeping track of the passage of 
time is important, the DM determines the time a task 
requires. The DM might use a different time scale 
depending on the context of the situation at hand. In 
a dungeon environment, the adventurers’ movement 
happens on a scale of minutes. It takes them about a 
minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute 
to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and 
a good ten minutes to search the cham ber beyond for 
anything interesting or valuable.
In a city or wilderness, a scale of hours is often more 
appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower 
at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles 
in just under four hours’ time.
For long journeys, a scale of days works best. 
Following the road from Baldur’s Gate to Waterdeep, the 
adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin 
ambush interrupts their journey.
In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game 
relies on rounds, a 6-second span of time described 
in chapter 9.
M o v e m e n t
Swim m ing across a rushing river, sneaking down a 
dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain s lo p e - 
all sorts of movement play a key role in D&D adventures.
The DM can sum m arize the adventurers’ movement 
without calculating exact distances or travel times: “You 
travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance 
late in the evening of the third day.” Even in a dungeon, 
particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the 
DM can summ arize movement between encounters: 
“After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient 
dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads 
you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm 
bridged by a narrow stone arch.”
Som etim es it’s important, though, to know how long 
it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the 
answer is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for 
determining travel time depend on two factors: the 
speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the 
terrain they're moving over.
S p e e d
Every character and monster has a speed, which is 
the distance in feet that the character or monster 
can walk in 1 round. This number assum es short 
bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life- 
threatening situation.
The following rules determine how far a character 
or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.
T r a v e l  Pa c e
W hile traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a 
normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace 
table. The table states how far the party can move in a 
period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A 
fast pace m akes characters less perceptive, while a slow 
pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an 
area m ore carefully (see the “Activity W hile Traveling” 
section later in this chapter for m ore information).
Forced March. The Travel Pace table assum es that 
characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on 
beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.
For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, 
the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour 
colum n for their pace, and each character must make 
a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The 
DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed 
saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion 
(see appendix A).
Mounts and Vehicles. For short spans of time (up 
to an hour), many animals move much faster than 
humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop 
for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for 
a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 
miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, 
but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.
Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land 
vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a 
waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel 
(see chapter 5), and they don’t suffer penalties for a fast 
pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on 
the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able 
to travel for up to 24 hours per day.
Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, 
or special vehicles, such as a carpet of 
flying, allow you 
to travel m ore swiftly. The Dungeon Master’s Guide 
contains m ore information on special m ethods of travel.
D i f f i c u l t  T e r r a i n
The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table 
assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, 
or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers often face 
dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep 
mountains, and ice-covered ground—all considered 
difficult terrain.
You move at half speed in difficult terrain—moving 
1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed—so you 
can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, 
an hour, or a day.
S p e c i a l  T y p e s  o f  M o v e m e n t
Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness 
areas often involves m ore than simply walking. 
Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jum p 
to get where they need to go.
C l i m b i n g , S w i m m i n g , a n d  C r a w l i n g
W hile climbing or swimming, each foot of movement 
costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless 
a creature has a climbing or swim m ing speed. At the 
DM ’s option, clim bing a slippery vertical surface or 
one with few handholds requires a successful Strength 
(Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in 
rough water might require a successful Strength 
(Athletics) check.
J u m p i n g
Your Strength determines how far you can jump.
Long 
Jump. W hen you make a long jump, you cover a 
number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at 
least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. W hen 
you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half 
that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the 
jum p costs a foot of movement.
This rule assum es that the height of your jum p 
doesn’t matter, such as a jum p across a stream or 
chasm. At your DM ’s option, you must succeed on a
DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle 
(no taller than a quarter of the jum p’s distance), such as 
a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.
W hen you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed 
on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your 
feet. Otherwise, you land prone.
High 
Jump. W hen you make a high jump, you leap 
into the air a num ber of feet equal to 3 + your Strength 
m odifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately 
before the jump. W hen you make a standing high jump, 
you can jum p only half that distance. Either way, each 
foot you clear on the jum p costs a foot o f movement. In 
som e circum stances, your DM might allow you to make 
a Strength (Athletics) check to jum p higher than you 
normally can.
You can extend your arms half your height above 
yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above 
you a distance equal to the height of the jum p plus 1
 1
/2 
times your height.
A c t i v i t y  W h i l e  T r a v e l i n g
As adventurers travel through a dungeon or the 
wilderness, they need to remain alert for danger, and 
som e characters might perform  other tasks to help 
the group’s journey.
M a r c h i n g  O r d e r
The adventurers should establish a m arching order.
A m arching order makes it easier to determine which 
characters are affected by traps, which ones can spot 
hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to those 
enem ies when a fight breaks out.
A character might occupy the front rank, one or m ore 
middle ranks, or the back rank. Characters in the front 
and back ranks need enough room  to travel side by 
side with others in their rank. W hen space is too tight, 
the marching order must change, usually by moving 
characters to a middle rank.
Fewer Than Three Ranks. If an adventuring party 
arranges its marching order with only two ranks, they 
are a front rank and a back rank. If there’s only one rank, 
it’s considered a front rank.
St e a l t h
W hile traveling at a slow pace, the characters can move 
stealthily. As long as they’re not in the open, they can try 
to surprise or sneak by other creatures they encounter. 
S ee the rules for hiding in chapter 7.
N o t i c i n g  T h r e a t s
Use the passive W isdom  (Perception) scores of the 
characters to determine whether anyone in the group 
notices a hidden threat. The DM might decide that a 
threat can be noticed only by characters in a particular 
rank. For example, as the characters are exploring a 
maze o f tunnels, the DM might decide that only those 
characters in the back rank have a chance to hear or 
spot a stealthy creature following the group, while 
characters in the front and middle ranks cannot.
W hile traveling at a fast pace, characters take a - 5  
penalty to their passive W isdom  (Perception) scores 
to notice hidden threats.

Encountering Creatures. If the DM determines 
that the adventurers encounter other creatures while 
they’re traveling, it’s up to both groups to decide what 
happens next. Either group might decide to attack, 
initiate a conversation, run away, or wait to see what the 
other group does.
Surprising Foes. If the adventurers encounter a 
hostile creature or group, the DM determines whether 
the adventurers or their foes might be surprised when 
com bat erupts. S ee chapter 9 for m ore about surprise.
O t h e r  A c t i v i t i e s
Characters w ho turn their attention to other tasks as the 
group travels are not focused on watching for danger. 
These characters don’t contribute their passive W isdom  
(Perception) scores to the group’s chance of noticing 
hidden threats. However, a character not watching for 
danger can do one of the following activities instead, or 
som e other activity with the DM ’s permission.
Navigate. The character can try to prevent the group 
from  becom ing lost, making a W isdom  (Survival) check 
when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master’s Guide 
has rules to determine whether the group gets lost.)
Draw a Map. The character can draw a map 
that records the group’s progress and helps the 
characters get back on course if they get lost. No ability 
check is required.
Track. A character can follow the tracks of another 
creature, making a W isdom  (Survival) check when the 
DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master’
s Guide has rules 
for tracking.)
Forage. The character can keep an eye out for ready 
sources of food and water, making a W isdom  (Survival) 
check when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master’s 
Guide has rules for foraging.)
T h e E n v i r o n m e n t
By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places 
that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be 
explored. The rules in this section cover som e of the 
most important ways in w hich adventurers interact with 
the environment in such places. The Dungeon Master’s 
Guide has rules covering m ore unusual situations.
F a l l i n g
A fall from a great height is one of the most com m on 
hazards facing an adventurer.
At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning 
damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. 
The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking 
damage from the fall.
S u f f o c a t i n g
A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes 
equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum 
of 30 seconds).
W hen a creature runs out of breath, it can survive for 
a number o f rounds equal to its Constitution modifier 
(minimum 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops 
to 0 hit points and is dying.
S p l i t t i n g  U p t h e  Pa r t y
Sometimes, it makes sense to split an adventuring party, 
especially if 
you want one or more characters to scout ahead. 
You can form multiple parties, each moving at a different speed. 
Each group has its own front, middle, and back ranks.
The drawback to this approach is that the party will be split 
into several smaller groups in the event of an attack. The 
advantage is that a small group of stealthy characters moving 
slowly might be able to sneak past enemies that clumsier 
characters would alert. A rogue and a monk moving at a slow 
pace are much harder to detect when they leave their dwarf 
paladin friend behind.
For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can 
hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it 
has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.
V i s i o n  a n d  L i g h t
The m ost fundamental tasks of adventuring—noticing 
danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in 
combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few— 
rely heavily on a character’s ability to see. Darkness 
and other effects that obscure vision can prove a 
significant hindrance.
A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In 
a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, 
or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on 
W isdom  (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
A heavily obscured area—such as darkness, opaque 
fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature 
in a heavily obscured area effectively suffers from the 
blinded condition (see appendix A).
The presence or absence of light in an environment 
creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim 
light, and darkness.
Bright light lets most creatures see normally. Even 
gloom y days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, 
fires, and other sources of illumination within a 
specific radius.
Dim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly 
obscured area. An area o f dim light is usually a 
boundary between a source of bright light, such as 
a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light 
of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A 
particularly brilliant full m oon might bathe the land 
in dim light.
Darkness creates a heavily obscured area. Characters 
face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit 
nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a 
subterranean vault, or in an area of m agical darkness.
B l i n d s i g h t
A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings 
without relying on sight, within a specific radius. 
Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures 
with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats 
and true dragons, have this sense.
D a r k v i s i o n
Many creatures in the w orlds o f D&D, especially those 
that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a 
specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in
darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas 
of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that 
creature is concerned. However, the creature can’t 
discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
T r u e s i g h t
A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, 
see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible 
creatures and objects, automatically detect visual 
illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, 
and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or 
a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, 
the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.
F o o d  a n d  W a t e r
Characters who don’t eat or drink suffer the effects of 
exhaustion (see appendix A). Exhaustion caused by lack 
of food or water can’t be removed until the character 
eats and drinks the full required amount.
F o o d
A character needs one pound of food per day and can 
m ake food last longer by subsisting on half rations. 
Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day 
without food.
A character can go without food for a number of days 
equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 
1). At the end o f each day beyond that limit, a character 
automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.
A normal day of eating resets the count of days 
without food to zero.
W a t e r
A  character needs one gallon of water per day, or two 
gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who 
drinks only half that much water must succeed on a 
DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of 
exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access 
to even less water automatically suffers one level of 
exhaustion at the end o f the day.
If the character already has one or m ore levels of 
exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.
I n t e r a c t i n g  w i t h  O b j e c t s
A character’s interaction with objects in an environment 
is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells 
the DM that his or her character is doing something, 
such a moving a lever, and the DM describes what, if 
anything happens.
For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, 
which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room  to 
flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. 
If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character 
might need to force it. In such a situation, the DM might 
call for a Strength check to see whether the character 
can wrench the lever into place. The DM sets the DC for 
any such check based on the difficulty of the task.
Characters can also damage objects with their 
w eapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and 
psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected 
by physical and magical attacks much like creatures
can. The DM determines an object’s Arm or Class and 
hit points, and might decide that certain objects have 
resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It’s 
hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects 
always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and 
they are immune to effects that require other saves. 
W hen an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.
A character can also attempt a Strength check to 
break an object. The DM sets the DC for any such check.
So c i a l  In t e r a c t io n
Exploring dungeons, overcom ing obstacles, and slaying 
m onsters are key parts of D&D adventures. No less 
important, though, are the social interactions that 
adventurers have with other inhabitants of the world.
Interaction takes on many forms. You might need 
to convince an unscrupulous thief to confess to som e 
m alfeasance, or you might try to flatter a dragon so that 
it will spare your life. The DM assum es the roles of any 
characters w ho are participating in the interaction that 
don’t belong to another player at the table. Any such 
character is called a nonplayer character (NPC).
In general terms, an N PC ’s attitude toward you is 
described as friendly, indifferent, or hostile. Friendly 
NPCs are predisposed to help you, and hostile ones are 
inclined to get in your way. It’s easier to get what you 
want from  a friendly NPC, o f course.
Social interactions have two primary aspects: 
roleplaying and ability checks.
R o l e p l a y i n g
Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role.
In this case, it’s you as a player determining how  your 
character thinks, acts, and talks.
Roleplaying is a part of every aspect o f the game, 
and it com es to the fore during social interactions.
Your character’s quirks, mannerisms, and personality 
influence how  interactions resolve.
There are two styles you can use when roleplaying 
your character: the descriptive approach and the active 
approach. Most players use a combination of the two 
styles. Use whichever m ix of the two works best for you.
D e s c r i p t i v e  A p p r o a c h  t o  R o l e p l a y i n g  
W ith this approach, you describe your character’s w ords 
and actions to the DM and the other players. Drawing on 
your mental image of your character, you tell everyone 
what your character does and how he or she does it.
For instance, Chris plays Tordek the dwarf. Tordek 
has a quick temper and blam es the elves of the 
Cloakwood for his family’s misfortune. At a tavern, an 
obnoxious elf minstrel sits at Tordek’s table and tries to 
strike up a conversation with the dwarf.
Chris says, “Tordek spits on the floor, growls an 
insult at the bard, and stomps over to the bar. He sits 
on a stool and glares at the minstrel before ordering 
another drink.”
In this example, Chris has conveyed Tordek’s m ood 
and given the DM a clear idea of his character’s 
attitude and actions.
W hen using descriptive roleplaying, keep the 
following things in mind:
•
 D escribe your character’s em otions and attitude.
•
 Focus on your character’s intent and how others 
might perceive it.
•
 Provide as much embellishment as you feel 
com fortable with.
D on’t w orry about getting things exactly right. Just 
focus on thinking about what your character would do 
and describing what you see in your mind.
A c t i v e  A p p r o a c h  t o  R o l e p l a y i n g
If descriptive roleplaying tells your DM and your fellow 
players what your character thinks and does, active 
roleplaying shows them.
W hen you use active roleplaying, you speak with your 
character’s voice, like an actor taking on a role. You might 
even echo your character’s movements and body language. 
This approach is m ore im mersive than descriptive 
roleplaying, though you still need to describe things 
that can’t be reasonably acted out.
Going back to the example of Chris roleplaying Tordek 
above, here’s how the scene might play out if Chris used 
active roleplaying:
Speaking as Tordek, Chris says in a gruff, deep voice, 
“I was w ondering why it suddenly sm elled awful in here. 
If I wanted to hear anything out o f you, I'd snap your 
arm and enjoy your scream s.” In his normal voice, Chris 
then adds, “I get up, glare at the elf, and head to the bar.”
R e s u l t s  o f  R o l e p l a y i n g  
The DM uses your character’s actions and attitudes to 
determine how an NPC reacts. A cowardly NPC buckles 
under threats of violence. A stubborn dwarf refuses to 
let anyone badger her. A vain dragon laps up flattery.
W hen interacting with an NPC, pay close attention to 
the DM ’s portrayal o f the N PC ’s m ood, dialogue, and 
personality. You might be able to determine an N PC ’s 
personality traits, ideals, flaws, and bonds, then play on 
them to influence the N PC ’s attitude.
Interactions in D&D are much like interactions in 
real life. If you can offer N PCs som ething they want, 
threaten them with som ething they fear, or play on their 
sympathies and goals, you can use words to get almost 
anything you want. On the other hand, if you insult a 
proud w arrior or speak ill of a noble’s allies, your efforts 
to convince or deceive will fall short.
A b i l i t y  C h e c k s
In addition to roleplaying, ability checks are key in 
determining the outcom e of an interaction.
Your roleplaying efforts can alter an N PC’s attitude, 
but there might still be an element of chance in the 
situation. For example, your DM can call for a Charisma 
check at any point during an interaction if he or she 
wants the dice to play a role in determining an N PC ’s 
reactions. Other checks might be appropriate in certain 
situations, at your DM ’s discretion.
Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking 
of how  you want to interact with an NPC, and stack 
the deck in your favor by using an approach that relies
on your best bonuses and skills. If the group needs to 
trick a guard into letting them into a castle, the rogue 
w ho is proficient in Deception is the best bet to lead the 
discussion. W hen negotiating for a hostage’s release, 
the cleric with Persuasion should do most of the talking.

H eroic though they might be, adventurers can’t spend 
every hour o f the day in the thick of exploration, social 
interaction, and combat. They need rest—time to 
sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds 
and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for 
further adventure.
Adventurers can take short rests in the midst of an 
adventuring day and a long rest to end the day.
S h o r t  R e s t
A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, 
during which a character does nothing m ore strenuous 
than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.
A  character can spend one or m ore Hit Dice at the end 
of a short rest, up to the character’s maximum number 
of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character's level. For 
each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die 
and adds the character’s Constitution modifier to it. The 
character regains hit points equal to the total. The player 
can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. 
A character regains som e spent Hit Dice upon finishing 
a long rest, as explained below.
L o n g  R e s t
A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 
hours long, during which a character sleeps or perform s 
light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch 
for no m ore than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a 
period of strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of walking, 
fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity— 
the characters must begin the rest again to gain any 
benefit from  it.
At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost 
hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up 
to a number of dice equal to half of the character’s total 
number of them. For example, if a character has eight 
Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon 
finishing a long rest.
A character can’t benefit from m ore than one long rest 
in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 
1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.
B e t w e e n  A d v e n t u r e s
Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient 
evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and 
prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also 
use this time to perform  other tasks, such as crafting 
arms and armor, perform ing research, or spending 
their hard-earned gold.
In som e cases, the passage o f time is som ething that 
occurs with little fanfare or description. W hen starting 
a new adventure, the DM might simply declare that a 
certain amount of time has passed and allow you to
describe in general terms what your character has 
been doing. At other times, the DM might want to keep 
track of 
just how  much time is passing as events beyond 
your perception stay in motion.
L i f e s t y l e  E x p e n s e s
Between adventures, you choose a particular quality 
of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle, as 
described in chapter 5.
Living a particular lifestyle doesn’t have a huge effect 
on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way 
other individuals and groups react to you. For example, 
when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier 
for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you 
live in poverty.
D o w n t i m e  A c t i v i t i e s
Between adventures, the DM might ask you what your 
character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods 
of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime 
activity requires a certain number of days to complete 
before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each 
day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day 
to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you 
have m ore than the minim um amount of days to spend, 
you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period 
of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.
Downtim e activities other than the ones presented 
below  are possible. If you want your character to spend 
his or her downtime perform ing an activity not covered 
here, discuss it with your DM.
C r a f t i n g
You can craft nonm agical objects, including adventuring 
equipment and w orks of art. You must be proficient 
with tools related to the object you are trying to create 
(typically artisan’s tools). You might also need access to 
special materials or locations necessary to create it. For 
example, som eone proficient with smith’s tools needs a 
forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.
For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you 
can craft one or m ore items with a total market value 
not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials 
worth half the total market value. If som ething you 
want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you 
make progress every day in 5-gp increments until you 
reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit 
of plate arm or (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days 
to craft by yourself.
Multiple characters can com bine their efforts toward 
the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters 
all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are 
working together in the same place. Each character 
contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent 
helping to craft the item. For example, three characters 
with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper 
facilities can craft a suit o f plate armor in 100 days, 
at a total cost o f 750 gp.
W hile crafting, you can maintain a m odest lifestyle 
without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable 
lifestyle at half the normal cost (see chapter 5 for more 
information on lifestyle expenses).
P r a c t i c i n g  a  P r o f e s s i o n
You can work between adventures, allowing you to 
maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp 
per day (see chapter 5 for more information on lifestyle 
expenses). This benefit lasts as long you continue to 
practice your profession.
If you are a m em ber of an organization that can 
provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a 
thieves’ guild, you earn enough to support a com fortable 
lifestyle instead.
If you have proficiency in the Perform ance skill and 
put your perform ance skill to use during your downtime, 
you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.
R e c u p e r a t i n g
You can use downtime between adventures to recover 
from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.
After three days of downtime spent recuperating, 
you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw.
On a successful save, you can choose one of the 
following results:
•
 End one effect on you that prevents you from  regain­
ing hit points.
•
 For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving 
throws against one disease or poison currently 
affecting you.
R e s e a r c h i n g
The time between adventures is a great chance to 
perform  research, gaining insight into mysteries 
that have unfurled over the course o f the campaign. 
Research can include poring over dusty tom es and 
crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the 
locals to pry rum ors and gossip from their lips.
W hen you begin your research, the DM determines 
whether the information is available, how many days of 
downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are 
any restrictions on your research (such as needing to 
seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The 
DM might also require you to make one or m ore ability 
checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check 
to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, 
or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure som eone’s 
aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the 
information if it is available.
For each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to 
cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your 
normal lifestyle expenses (as discussed in chapter 5).
T r a i n i n g
You can spend time between adventures learning a new 
language or training with a set of tools. Your DM might 
allow additional training options.
First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. 
The DM determines how long it takes, and whether one 
or m ore ability checks are required.
The training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 gp per day. 
After you spend the requisite amount of time and money, 
you learn the new language or gain proficiency with 
the new tool.
C h a p t e r  9: C o m b a t
T
HE CLATTER OF A SWORD STRIKING AGAINST
a shield. The terrible rending sound as 
m onstrous claws tear through armor. A 
brilliant flash of light as a ball of flame 
blossom s from a w izard’s spell. The sharp 
tang of blood in the air, cutting through 
the stench of vile monsters. Roars of fury, 
shouts of triumph, cries of pain. Combat in D&D can be 
chaotic, deadly, and thrilling.
This chapter provides the rules you need for your 
characters and m onsters to engage in combat, whether 
it is a brief skirm ish or an extended conflict in a 
dungeon or on a field o f battle. Throughout this chapter, 
the rules address you, the player or Dungeon Master. 
The Dungeon Master controls all the monsters and 
nonplayer characters involved in combat, and each other 
player controls an adventurer. “You” can also mean the 
character or monster that you control.
T h e O rder of C o m b a t
A typical com bat encounter is a clash between two 
sides, a flurry of w eapon swings, feints, parries, 
footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes the 
chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A 
round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. 
During a round, each participant in a battle takes a 
turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning 
of a com bat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. 
Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to 
the next round if neither side has defeated the other.
S u r p r i s e
A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, 
springing from  the trees to attack them. A  gelatinous 
cube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by 
the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In 
these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise 
over the other.
The DM determines w ho might be surprised. If 
neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice 
each other. Otherwise, the DM com pares the Dexterity 
(Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive 
W isdom  (Perception) score of each creature on the
C o m b a t  S t e p  b y S t e p
1. Determine surprise. The DM determines whether anyone 
involved in the combat encounter is surprised.
2. 
Establish positions. The DM decides where all the 
characters and monsters are located. Given the 
adventurers’ marching order or their stated positions in
 
the room or other location, the DM figures out where the 
adversaries are— how far away and in what direction.
3. Roll initiative. Everyone involved in the combat encounter 
rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants’ turns.
4. 
Take turns. Each participant in the battle takes a turn in 
initiative order.
5. 
Begin the next round. When everyone involved in the 
combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until 
the fighting stops.
opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn’t 
notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.
If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action 
on your first turn of the combat, and you can’t take a 
reaction until that turn ends. A m em ber of a group can 
be surprised even if the other m em bers aren’t.
I n i t i a t i v e
Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. 
W hen combat starts, every participant makes a 
Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative 
order. The DM makes one roll for an entire group of 
identical creatures, so each m em ber of the group acts at 
the same time.
The DM ranks the combatants in order from the one 
with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with 
the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) 
in which they act during each round. The initiative order 
remains the same from round to round.
If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order among 
tied DM-controlled creatures, and the players decide 
the order am ong their tied characters. The DM can 
decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a 
player character. Optionally, the DM can have the tied 
characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine 
the order, highest roll going first.
Y o u r  T u r n
On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed 
and take one action. You decide whether to move first 
or take your action first. Your speed—som etim es called 
your walking speed—is noted on your character sheet.
The most com m on actions you can take are described 
in the “Actions in Com bat” section later in this chapter. 
Many class features and other abilities provide 
additional options for your action.
The “Movement and Position” section later in this 
chapter gives the rules for your move.
You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing 
anything at all on your turn. If you can’t decide what to 
do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready 
action, as described in “Actions in Combat.”
B o n u s  A c t i o n s
Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you 
take an additional action on your turn called a bonus 
action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows 
a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus 
action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature 
of the game states that you can do som ething as a bonus 
action. You otherwise don’t have a bonus action to take.
You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so 
you must choose which bonus action to use w hen you 
have m ore than one available.
You choose when to take a bonus action during your 
turn, unless the bonus action’s timing is specified, and 
anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions 
also prevents you from taking a bonus action.
O t h e r  A c t i v i t y  o n  Y o u r  T u r n
Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require 
neither your action nor your move.
You can com m unicate however you are able, through 
brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.
You can also interact with one object or feature of the 
environment for free, during either your move or your 
action. For example, you could open a door during your 
move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your 
weapon as part of the sam e action you use to attack.
If you want to interact with a second object, you need 
to use your action. S om e magic items and other special 
objects always require an action to use, as stated 
in their descriptions.
The DM might require you to use an action for any 
of these activities w hen it needs special care or when it 
presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the DM 
could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a 
stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.
R e a c t i o n s
Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow 
you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction 
is an instant response to a trigger of som e kind, which 
can occur on your turn or on som eone else’s. The 
opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the 
most com m on type of reaction.
W hen you take a reaction, you can’t take another one 
until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts 
another creature’s turn, that creature can continue its 
turn right after the reaction.
M o v e m e n t  a n d  Po s it io n
In combat, characters and m onsters are in constant 
motion, often using movement and position to gain 
the upper hand.
I n t e r a c t i n g  w i t h  O b j e c t s  A r o u n d  Y o u
Here are a few examples of the sorts of 
thing you can do in 
tandem with your movement and action:
•
 draw or sheathe a sword
•
 open or close a door
•
 withdraw a potion from your backpack
•
 pick up a dropped axe
•
 take a bauble from a table
•
 remove a ring from your finger
•
 stuff some food into your mouth
•
 plant a banner in the ground
•
 fish a few coins from your belt pouch
•
 drink all the ale in a flagon
•
 throw a lever or a switch
•
 pull a torch from a sconce
•
 take a book from a shelf 
you can reach
•
 extinguish a small flame
•
 don a mask
•
 pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head
•
 put your ear to a door
•
 kick a small stone
•
 turn a key in a lock
•
 tap the floor with a 10-foot pole
•
 hand an item to another character
On your turn, you can move a distance up to your 
speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as 
you like on your turn, following the rules here.
Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and 
swimming. These different m odes of movement can 
be com bined with walking, or they can constitute your 
entire move. However you’re moving, you deduct the 
distance of each part of your move from  your speed until 
it is used up or until you are done moving.
The “Special Types of Movement’’ section in 
chapter 8 gives the particulars for jumping, climbing, 
and swimming.
B r e a k i n g  U p  Y o u r  M o v e
You can break up your movement on your turn, using 
som e of your speed before and after your action. For 
example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 
10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.
M o v i n g  b e t w e e n  A t t a c k s
If you take an action that includes m ore than one 
weapon attack, you can break up your movement even 
further by moving between those attacks. For example, 
a fighter w ho can make two attacks with the Extra 
Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could 
move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then 
attack again.
U s in g  D i f f e r e n t  S p e e d s
If you have m ore than one speed, such as your walking 
speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth 
between your speeds during your move. W henever you 
switch, subtract the distance you've already m oved from 
the new speed. The result determines how much farther 
you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can’t use the 
new speed during the current move.
For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying 
speed of 60 because a wizard cast the fly spell on you, 
you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap 
into the air to fly 30 feet more.
D i f f i c u l t  T e r r a i n
Combat rarely takes place in bare room s or on 
featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar- 
choked forests, treacherous staircases—the setting of 
a typical fight contains difficult terrain.
Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 
extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in 
a space count as difficult terrain.
Low  furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, 
snow, and shallow bogs are examples o f difficult terrain. 
The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, 
also counts as difficult terrain.
B e i n g  P r o n e
Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, 
either because they are knocked down or because they 
throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, 
a condition described in appendix A.
You can drop prone without using any of your 
speed. Standing up takes m ore effort; doing so costs
an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For 
example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet 
of movement to stand up. You can’t stand up if you don’t 
have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.
To move while prone, you must crawl or use magic 
such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while 
crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult 
terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.
M o v i n g  A r o u n d  O t h e r  
C r e a t u r e s  
You can move through a nonhostile creature’s space.
In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature's 
space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or 
smaller than you. Rem em ber that another creature’s 
space is difficult terrain for you.
W hether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t 
willingly end your move in its space.
If you leave a hostile creature’s reach during your 
move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained 
later in the chapter.
F l y i n g  M o v e m e n t
Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but 
they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying 
creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or 
is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature 
falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held 
aloft by magic, such as by the fly spell.
C r e a t u r e  S i z e
Each creature takes up a different amount of space.
The Size Categories table shows how much space 
a creature o f a particular size controls in combat.
Objects som etim es use the same size categories.

S p a c e
A creature's space is the area in feet that it effectively 
controls in combat, not an expression of its physical 
dim ensions. A typical M edium creature isn't 5 feet 
wide, for example, but it does control a space that 
wide. If a M edium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide 
doorway, other creatures can’t get through unless the 
hobgoblin lets them.
A creature’s space also reflects the area it needs to 
fight effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the 
number of creatures that can surround another creature 
in combat. Assum ing Medium combatants, eight 
creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.
Because larger creatures take up m ore space, fewer 
o f them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures

If 
you play out a combat using a square grid and miniatures 
or other tokens, follow these rules.
Squares. Each square on the grid represents 5 feet.
Speed. Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by 
square on the grid. This means you use your speed in 5-foot 
segments. This is particularly easy if you translate your speed 
into squares by dividing the speed by 5. For example, a speed 
of 30 feet translates into a speed of 6 squares.
If you use a grid often, consider writing your speed in 
squares on your character sheet.
Entering a Square. To enter a square, you must have 
at least 1
 square of movement left, even if 
the square is 
diagonally adjacent to the square you’re in. (The rule for 
diagonal movement sacrifices realism for the sake of smooth 
play. The Dungeon M aster’
s Guide provides guidance on using 
a more realistic approach.)
If a square costs extra movement, as a square of difficult 
terrain does, you must have enough movement left to pay for 
entering it. For example, you must have at least 2 squares of 
movement left to enter a square of difficult terrain.
Corners. Diagonal movement can’t cross the corner of a 
wall, large tree, or other terrain feature that fills its space.
Ranges. To determine the range on a grid between two 
things— whether creatures or objects— start counting squares 
from a square adjacent to one of them and stop counting in 
the space of the other one. Count by the shortest route.
 
crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there’s little 
room  for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty 
Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.
S q u e e z i n g  i n t o  a  S m a l l e r  S p a c e
A creature can squeeze through a space that is large 
enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a 
Large creature can squeeze through a passage that's 
only 5 feet wide. W hile squeezing through a space, 
a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it 
moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls 
and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the 
creature have advantage while it’s in the smaller space.
A c t io n s in  C o m b a t
W hen you take your action on your turn, you can take 
one of the actions presented here, an action you gained 
from your class or a special feature, or an action that 
you improvise. Many monsters have action options of 
their own in their stat blocks.
W hen you describe an action not detailed elsewhere 
in the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is 
possible and what kind o f roll you need to make, if any, 
to determine success or failure.
A t t a c k
The most com m on action to take in combat is the Attack 
action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an 
arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.
With this action, you make one melee or ranged 
attack. See the “Making an Attack” section for the rules 
that govern attacks.
Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature 
of the fighter, allow you to make m ore than one attack 
with this action.
C a s t  a  S p e l l
Spellcasters such as w izards and clerics, as well as 
many monsters, have access to spells and can use 
them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting 
time, which specifies whether the caster must use an 
action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the 
spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an 
action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, 
so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat 
to cast such a spell. See chapter 10 for the rules 
on spellcasting.
D a s h
W hen you take the Dash action, you gain extra 
movement for the current turn. The increase equals 
your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed 
of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your 
turn if 
you dash.
Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this 
additional movement by the same amount. If your speed 
of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can 
move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.

If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn’t 
provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.
D o d g e
W hen you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on 
avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any 
attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you 
can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving 
throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are 
incapacitated (as explained in appendix A) or if your 
speed drops to 0.
H e l p
You can lend your aid to another creature in the 
completion of a task. W hen you take the Help action, 
the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability 
check it makes to perform  the task you are helping with, 
provided that it makes the check before the start of 
your next turn.
Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in 
attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, 
distract the target, or in som e other way team up to 
make your ally’s attack m ore effective. If your ally 
attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack 
roll is made with advantage.
H i d e
W hen you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity 
(Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules 
in chapter 7 for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain 
benefits, as described in the “Unseen Attackers and 
Targets” section later in this chapter.

Your character can do things not covered by the actions in 
this chapter, such as breaking down doors, intimidating 
enemies, sensing weaknesses in magical defenses, or calling 
for a parley with a foe. The only limits to the actions you can 
attempt are your imagination and your character’s ability 
scores. See the descriptions of the ability scores in chapter 7 
for inspiration as you improvise.
When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in 
the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible 
and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine 
success or failure.

W hen you take the Search action, you devote your 
attention to finding something. Depending on the 
nature of your search, the DM might have you make 
a W isdom  (Perception) check or an Intelligence 
(Investigation) check.
U s e  a n  O b j e c t
You normally interact with an object while doing 
som ething else, such as when you draw a sword as part 
of an attack. W hen an object requires your action for 
its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action 
is also useful when you want to interact with m ore than 
one object on your turn.
W hether you’re striking with a melee weapon, firing a 
w eapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a 
spell, an attack has a simple structure.
Som etim es you want to get the jum p on a foe or wait for 
a particular circum stance before you act. To do so, you 
can take the Ready action on your turn so that you can 
act later in the round using your reaction.
First, you decide what perceivable circum stance 
will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action 
you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose 
to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples 
include “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the 
lever that opens it,” and “If the goblin steps next to me,
I move away.”
W hen the trigger occurs, you can either take your 
reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore 
the trigger. Rem em ber that you can take only one 
reaction per round.
W hen you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but 
hold its energy, which you release with your reaction 
when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must 
have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the 
spell’s magic requires concentration (explained in 
chapter 10). If your concentration is broken, the spell 
dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are 
concentrating on the web spell and ready magic missile, 
your web spell ends, and if you take damage before 
you release magic missile with your reaction, your 
concentration might be broken.
A t t a c k  R o l l s
W hen you make an attack, your attack roll determines 
whether the attack hits or m isses. To make an attack 
roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the 
total o f the roll plus m odifiers equals or exceeds the 
target’s Arm or Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC o f a 
character is determined at character creation, whereas 
the AC of a monster is in its stat block.
M o d i f i e r s  t o  t h e  R o l l
W hen a character makes an attack roll, the two most 
com m on modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier 
and the character’s proficiency bonus. W hen a monster 
m akes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is 
provided in its stat block.
Ability Modifier. The ability modifier used for a melee 
weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used 
for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. W eapons that 
have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.
Som e spells also require an attack roll. The ability 
m odifier used for a spell attack depends on the 
spellcasting ability o f the spellcaster, as explained 
in chapter 10.
Proficiency Bonus. You add your proficiency bonus 
to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with 
which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack 
with a spell.
R o l l i n g  1 o r  2 0
Som etim es fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing 
the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.
If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits 
regardless o f any modifiers or the target’s AC. In 
addition, the attack is a critical hit, as explained later 
in this chapter.
If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack m isses 
regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC.

1. Choose a target. Pick a target within your attack’s 
range: a creature, an object, or a location.
2. Determine modifiers. The DM determines whether 
the target has cover and whether you have advantage 
or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, 
special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties 
or bonuses to your attack roll.
3. Resolve the attack. You make the attack roll. On a 
hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has 
rules that specify otherwise. S om e attacks cause 
special effects in addition to or instead o f damage.
If there’s ever any question whether som ething you’re 
doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you’re 
making an attack roll, you’re making an attack.
Combatants often try to escape their foes’ notice 
by hiding, casting the invisibility spell, or lurking 
in darkness.
W hen you attack a target that you can’t see, you have 
disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether 
you’re guessing the target’s location or you’re targeting 
a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn’t in
the location you targeted, you automatically m iss, but 
the DM typically just says that the attack m issed, not 
whether you guessed the target’s location correctly.
W hen a creature can’t see you, you have advantage on 
attack rolls against it.
If you are hidden—both unseen and unheard—when 
you make an attack, you give away your location when 
the attack hits or m isses.

W hen you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow  or a 
crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles 
to strike a foe at a distance. A  monster might shoot 
spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a 
ranged attack.
R a n g e
You can make ranged attacks only against targets within 
a specified range.
If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a 
single range, you can’t attack a target beyond this range.
S om e ranged attacks, such as those made with a 
longbow  or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller 
number is the normal range, and the larger num ber is 
the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when 
your target is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack 
a target beyond the long range.
R a n g e d  A t t a c k s  i n  C l o s e  C o m b a t
Aiming a ranged attack is m ore difficult when a foe 
is next to you. W hen you make a ranged attack with 
a weapon, a spell, or som e other means, you have 
disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet 
o f a hostile creature who can see you and w ho isn’t 
incapacitated.
M e l e e  A t t a c k s
Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows 
you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack 
typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, 
a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a 
melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, 
tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve 
making a melee attack.
M ost creatures have a 5-foot reach and can thus 
attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a 
m elee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger 
than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach 
than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.
W hen you are unarmed, you can fight in melee by 
making an unarmed strike, as shown in the weapon 
table in chapter 5.
O p p o r t u n i t y  A t t a c k s
In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for enemies 
to drop their guard. You can rarely move heedlessly past 
your foes without putting yourself in danger; doing so 
provokes an opportunity attack.
You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile 
creature that you can see m oves out of your reach. To 
make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction 
to make one melee attack against the provoking

Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of 
your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This 
section includes the most common contests that require an 
action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The DM 
can use these contests as models for improvising others.
creature. The attack interrupts the provoking creature’s 
movement, occurring right before the creature 
leaves your reach.
You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by 
taking the Disengage action. You also don’t provoke an 
opportunity attack when you teleport or when som eone 
or som ething m oves you without using your movement, 
action, or reaction. For example, you don’t provoke an 
opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe’s 
reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.
Two-W e a p o n  F i g h t i n g
W hen you take the Attack action and attack with a light 
melee weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can 
use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee 
weapon that you’re holding in the other hand. You don’t 
add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus 
attack, unless that modifier is negative.
If either weapon has the thrown property, you 
can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee 
attack with it.
G r a p p l i n g
W hen you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, 
you can use the Attack action to make a special melee 
attack, a grapple. If you’re able to make multiple attacks 
with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.
The target of your grapple must be no m ore than one 
size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. 
Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target 
by making a grapple check, a Strength (Athletics) 
check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or 
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the 
ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to 
the grappled condition (see appendix A). The condition 
specifies the things that end it, and you can release the 
target whenever you like (no action required).
Escaping a Grapple. A grappled creature can use its 
action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength 
(Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by 
your Strength (Athletics) check.
Moving a Grappled Creature. W hen you move, you 
can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but 
your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more 
sizes smaller than you.
S h o v i n g  a  C r e a t u r e
Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee 
attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or 
push it away from  you. If you’re able to make multiple 
attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces 
one of them.
The target of your shove must be no m ore than one 
size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. 
You make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the 
target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics)
check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win 
the contest, you either knock the target prone or push 
it 5 feet away from you.
C o v e r
Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide 
cover during combat, making a target m ore difficult 
to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an 
attack or other effect originates on the opposite side 
of the cover.
There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind 
multiple sources of cover, only the most protective 
degree o f cover applies; the degrees aren't added 
together. For example, if a target is behind a creature 
that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three- 
quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.
A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and 
Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an 
obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle 
might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow 
tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an 
enemy or a friend.
A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus 
to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three- 
quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered 
by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an 
arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.
A target with total cover can’t be targeted directly 
by an attack or a spell, although som e spells can reach 
such a target by including it in an area of effect. A 
target has total cover if it is completely concealed by 
an obstacle.
D a m a g e  a n d  H e a l in g
Injury and the risk of death are constant com panions 
of those who explore the w orlds of D&D. The thrust of 
a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a 
fireball spell all have the potential to damage, or even 
kill, the hardiest of creatures.
H i t  P o i n t s
Hit points represent a combination of physical and 
mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures 
with m ore hit points are m ore difficult to kill. Those 
with fewer hit points are m ore fragile.
A creature’s current hit points (usually just called hit 
points) can be any number from the creature’s hit point 
maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently 
as a creature takes damage or receives healing.
W henever a creature takes damage, that damage is 
subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has 
no effect on a creature’s capabilities until the creature 
drops to 0 hit points.
D a m a g e  R o l l s
Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability 
specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die 
or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to 
your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other 
factors can grant a bonus to damage.
W hen attacking with a weapon, you add your ability 
modifier—the same modifier used for the attack roll— 
to the damage. A spell tells you which dice to roll for 
damage and whether to add any modifiers.
If a spell or other effect deals damage to more than 
one target at the sam e time, roll the damage once for 
all of them. For example, when a wizard casts fireball or 
a cleric casts flame strike, the spell’s damage is rolled 
once for all creatures caught in the blast.
C r i t i c a l  H it s
W hen you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice 
for the attack’s damage against the target. Roll all of the 
attack’s damage dice twice and add them together. Then 
add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, 
you can roll all the damage dice at once.
For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, 
roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add 
your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other 
damage dice, such as from the rogue’s Sneak Attack 
feature, you roll those dice twice as well.
D a m a g e  T y p e s
Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful 
effects deal different types of damage. Damage types 
have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as 
damage resistance, rely on the types.
The damage types follow, with examples to help a 
DM assign a damage type to a new effect.
Acid. The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath 
and the dissolving enzym es secreted by a black pudding 
deal acid damage.
Bludgeoning. Blunt force attacks—hammers, falling, 
constriction, and the like—deal bludgeoning damage.
Cold. The infernal chill radiating from  an ice devil’s 
spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath 
deal cold damage.
Fire. Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells 
conjure flames to deal fire damage.
Force. Force is pure magical energy focused into a 
damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are 
spells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon.
Lightning. A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon’s 
breath deal lightning damage.
Necrotic. Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead 
and a spell such as chill touch, withers matter and 
even the soul.
Piercing. Puncturing and impaling attacks, including 
spears and m onsters’ bites, deal piercing damage.
Poison. Venomous stings and the toxic gas o f a green 
dragon’s breath deal poison damage.
Psychic. Mental abilities such as a mind flayer’s 
psionic blast deal psychic damage.
Radiant. Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric’s flame 
strike spell or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh 
like fire and overloads the spirit with power.
Slashing. Swords, axes, and m onsters’ claws deal 
slashing damage.
Thunder. A concussive burst of sound, such as the 
effect o f the thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.
D a m a g e  R e s i s t a n c e  a n d  
V u l n e r a b i l i t y
S om e creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or 
unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.
If a creature or an object has resistance to a damage 
type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a 
creature or an object has vulnerability to a damage 
type, damage of that type is doubled against it.
Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after 
all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature 
has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an 
attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature 
is also within a m agical aura that reduces all damage by
5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, 
so the creature takes 10 damage.
Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that 
affect the sam e damage type count as only one instance. 
For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage 
as w ell as resistance to all nonm agical damage, the 
damage of a nonm agical fire is reduced by half against 
the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.
H e a l i n g
Unless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even 
death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can 
restore a creature's hit points (as explained in chapter 
8), and magical m ethods such as a cure wounds spell or 
a potion of 
healing can remove damage in an instant.
W hen a creature receives healing of any kind, hit 
points regained are added to its current hit points. A 
creature’s hit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum, 
so any hit points regained in excess of this num ber are 
lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of 
healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a 
hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points 
from the druid, not 8.
A  creature that has died can’t regain hit points until 
magic such as the revivify spell has restored it to life.
D r o p p i n g  t o  0  H i t  P o i n t s
W hen you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or 
fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.
I n s t a n t  D e a t h
Massive damage can kill you instantly. W hen damage 
reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage 
remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals 
or exceeds your hit point maximum.
For example, a cleric with a m aximum of 
12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she 
takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced 
to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because 
the remaining damage equals her hit point 
maximum, the cleric dies.
Fa l l i n g  U n c o n s c i o u s
If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill 
you, you fall unconscious (see appendix A). This 
unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.
D e s c r i b i n g  t h e  E f f e c t s  o f  D a m a g e
Dungeon Masters describe hit point loss in different ways. 
When your current hit point total is half or more of your hit 
point maximum, you typically show no signs of injury. When 
you drop below half your hit point maximum, you show signs 
of 
wear, such as cuts and bruises. An attack that reduces you 
to 0 hit points strikes you directly, leaving a bleeding injury or 
other trauma, or it simply knocks you unconscious.
D e a t h  Sa v i n g  T h r o w s
W henever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you 
must make a special saving throw, called a death saving 
throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death 
or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one 
isn’t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate 
now, aided only by spells and features that improve your 
chances of succeeding on a saving throw.
Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. 
Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect 
by itself. On your third success, you becom e stable (see 
below). On your third failure, you die. The successes 
and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track 
of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of 
both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or 
becom e stable.
Rolling 1 or 20. W hen you make a death saving throw 
and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you 
roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.
Damage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage while 
you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw 
failure. If the damage is from  a critical hit, you suffer 
two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds 
your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.
St a b i l i z i n g  a  C r e a t u r e
The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to 
heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at 
least be stabilized so that it isn’t killed by a failed death 
saving throw.
You can use your action to administer first aid to an 
unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which 
requires a successful DC 10 W isdom  (Medicine) check.
A  stable creature doesn’t make death saving throws, 
even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain 
unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must
start making death saving throws again, if it takes any 
damage. A stable creature that isn’t healed regains 
1 hit point after 1d4 hours.
M o n s t e r s  a n d  D e a t h
Most DMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 
0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and 
make death saving throws.
Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters 
are com m on exceptions; the DM might have them 
fall unconscious and follow the sam e rules as 
player characters.
K n o c k i n g  a  C r e a t u r e  O u t
Som etim es an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, 
rather than deal a killing blow. W hen an attacker 
reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, 
the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker 
can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. 
The creature falls unconscious and is stable.
T e m p o r a r y  H i t  P o i n t s
Som e spells and special abilities confer temporary hit 
points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren’t actual 
hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit 
points that protect you from injury.
W hen you have temporary hit points and take damage, 
the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover 
damage carries over to your normal hit points. For 
example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 
7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then 
take 2 damage.
Because temporary hit points are separate from 
your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point 
maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit 
points and receive temporary hit points.
Healing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they 
can’t be added together. If you have temporary hit points 
and receive m ore of them, you decide whether to keep 
the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, 
if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you 
already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.
If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points 
doesn’t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. 
They can still absorb damage directed at you while 
you’re in that state, but only true healing can save you.
Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points 
has a duration, they last until they’re depleted or you 
finish a long rest.
M o u n t e d  C o m b a t
A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard 
casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a cleric 
soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the 
benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.
A willing creature that is at least one size larger than 
you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a 
mount, using the following rules.
M o u n t i n g  a n d  D i s m o u n t i n g
Once during your move, you can mount a creature that 
is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an 
amount of movement equal to half your speed. For 
example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 
feet of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can’t 
mount it if you don’t have 15 feet o f movement left or 
if your speed is 0.
If an effect m oves your mount against its w ill while 
you’re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity 
saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a 
space within 5 feet of it. If you’re knocked prone while 
mounted, you must make the same saving throw.
If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your 
reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. 
Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a 
space within 5 feet it.
C o n t r o l l i n g  a  M o u n t
W hile you're mounted, you have two options. You 
can either control the mount or allow it to act 
independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, 
act independently.
You can control a mount only if it has been trained 
to accept a rider. Dom esticated horses, donkeys, and 
similar creatures are assum ed to have such training. 
The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match 
yours when you mount it. It m oves as you direct it, and 
it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and 
Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on 
the turn that you mount it.
An independent mount retains its place in the 
initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on 
the actions the mount can take, and it m oves and acts 
as it wishes. It might flee from  combat, rush to attack 
and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against 
your wishes.
In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity 
attack while you’re on it, the attacker can target you 
or the mount.

W hen adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their

Underwater the following rules apply.
W hen making a melee weapon attack, a creature 
that doesn’t have a swim m ing speed (either natural or

a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, 
trident, or dart).
Creatures and objects that are fully im m ersed in 
water have resistance to fire damage.

M
AGIC PERMEATES THE WORLDS OF D&D AND
most often appears in the form o f a spell. 
This chapter provides the rules for 
casting spells. Different character 
classes have distinctive ways of learning 
and preparing their spells, and monsters 
use spells in unique ways. Regardless of its source, 
a spell follows the rules here.
W h a t  I s a  Spell?
A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping 
of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse 
into a specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, 
a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of 
raw m agic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a 
particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, 
and then releases them to unleash the desired effect—in 
most cases, all in the span o f seconds.
Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective 
wards. They can deal damage or undo it, im pose or 
remove conditions (see appendix A), drain life energy 
away, and restore life to the dead.
Uncounted thousands of spells have been created 
over the course of the multiverse’s history, and many of 
them are long forgotten. Som e might yet lie recorded in 
crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped 
in the minds of dead gods. Or they might som eday be 
reinvented by a character who has am assed enough 
power and w isdom  to do so.
S p e l l  L e v e l
Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell’s level is a 
general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly 
(but still impressive) magic missile at 1st level and 
the earth-shaking wish at 9th. Cantrips—simple but 
powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote— 
are level 0. The higher a spell’s level, the higher level a 
spellcaster must be to use that spell.
Spell level and character level don’t correspond 
directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th 
level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.
K n o w n  a n d  P r e p a r e d  S p e l l s
Before a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must 
have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access 
to the spell in a magic item. M embers o f a few classes, 
including bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of 
spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The 
same thing is true o f many magic-using monsters. Other 
spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a 
process o f preparing spells. This process varies for 
different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.
C a s t i n g  in A r m o r
Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required 
for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you 
are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted 
and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.
In every case, the number o f spells a caster can 
have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the 
character’s level.
S p e l l  S l o t s
Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or 
prepares, he or she can cast only a limited num ber of 
spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic 
and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is 
physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells 
are even m ore so. Thus, each spellcasting class’s 
description (except that of the warlock) includes a table 
showing how many spell slots of each spell level a 
character can use at each character level. For example, 
the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots 
and two 2nd-level slots.
W hen a character casts a spell, he or she expends 
a slot of that spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” 
a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a 
groove of a certain size—small for a 1st-level slot, larger 
for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot 
of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level 
slot. S o when Umara casts magic missile, a 1st-level 
spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has 
three remaining.
Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots 
(see chapter 8 for the rules on resting).
Som e characters and m onsters have special abilities 
that let them cast spells without using spell slots. For 
example, a m onk who follows the Way o f the Four 
Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch 
invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all 
cast spells in such a way.
C a s t i n g  a  S p e l l  a t  a  H i g h e r  L e v e l  
W hen a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a 
higher level than the spell, the spell assum es the higher 
level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts magic 
missile using one of her 2nd-level slots, that magic 
missile is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill 
the slot it is put into.
Som e spells, such as magic missile and cure wounds, 
have m ore powerful effects when cast at a higher level, 
as detailed in a spell’s description.
C a n t r i p s
A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without 
using a spell slot and without being prepared in 
advance. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the 
caster’s mind and infused the caster with the magic 
needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip’s 
spell level is 0.
R i t u a l s
Certain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell 
can be cast following the norm al rules for spellcasting, 
or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of 
a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal.
It also doesn’t expend a spell slot, which m eans the 
ritual version of a spell can’t be cast at a higher level.
To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a 
feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the 
druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must 
also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells 
known, unless the character’s ritual feature specifies 
otherwise, as the wizard’s does.
C a s t i n g  a  Spell
W hen a character casts any spell, the sam e basic rules 
are followed, regardless of the character’s class or the 
spell’s effects.
Each spell description in chapter 11 begins with a block 
of information, including the spell’s name, level, school 
of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. 
The rest of a spell entry describes the spell’s effect.
C a s t i n g  T i m e
Most spells require a single action to cast, but som e 
spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more 
time to cast.
B o n u s  A c t i o n
A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You 
must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, 
provided that you haven’t already taken a bonus action 
this turn. You can’t cast another spell during the same 
turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.
R e a c t i o n s
Som e spells can be cast as reactions. These spells 
take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast 
in response to som e event. If a spell can be cast as a 
reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when 
you can do so.
L o n g e r  C a s t i n g  T im e s
Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require 
m ore time to cast: minutes or even hours. W hen you 
cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single 
action or reaction, you must spend your action each 
turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your 
concentration while you do so (see “Concentration” 
below). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, 
but you don’t expend a spell slot. If you want to try 
casting the spell again, you must start over.
R a n g e
The target of a spell must be within the spell’s range.
For a spell like magic missile, the target is a creature. 
For a spell like fireball, the target is the point in space 
where the ball of fire erupts.
M ost spells have ranges expressed in feet. Som e 
spells can target only a creature (including you) that you 
touch. Other spells, such as the shield spell, affect only 
you. These spells have a range of self.
Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate 
from you also have a range o f self, indicating that the 
origin point of the spell’s effect must be you (see “Areas 
o f Effect” later in the this chapter).
Once a spell is cast, its effects aren’t limited by its 
range, unless the spell’s description says otherwise.
C o m p o n e n t s
A spell’s com ponents are the physical requirements you 
must meet in order to cast it. Each spell’s description 
indicates whether it requires verbal (V), som atic (S), 
or material (M) com ponents. If you can’t provide one 
or m ore of a spell’s com ponents, you are unable to 
cast the spell.
V e r b a l  (V )
Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The 
w ords themselves aren’t the source o f the spell’s power; 
rather, the particular combination of sounds, with 
specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic 
in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area 
of silence, such as one created by the silence spell, can’t 
cast a spell with a verbal component.
S o m a t i c  (S)
Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful 
gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell 
requires a som atic component, the caster must have free 
use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.
M a t e r i a l  (M )
Casting som e spells requires particular objects, 
specified in parentheses in the com ponent entry.
A character can use a component pouch or a 
spellcasting focus (found in chapter 5) in place of 
the com ponents specified for a spell. But if a cost is 
indicated for a component, a character must have that 
specific com ponent before he or she can cast the spell.
If a spell states that a material com ponent is 
consum ed by the spell, the caster must provide this 
com ponent for each casting of the spell.
A spellcaster must have a hand free to access these 
com ponents, but it can be the sam e hand that he or she 
uses to perform  som atic components.
D u r a t i o n
A spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists. 
A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, 
or even years. Som e spells specify that their effects last 
until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.
I n s t a n t a n e o u s
Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, 
heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way 
that can’t be dispelled, because its magic exists only 
for an instant.
C o n c e n t r a t i o n
Som e spells require you to maintain concentration 
in order to keep their m agic active. If you lose 
concentration, such a spell ends.
If a spell must be maintained with concentration, 
that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell 
specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can 
end concentration at any time (no action required).
T h e  S c h o o l s  o f  M a g i c
Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called 
schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these 
categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in 
essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous 
study or is bestowed by a deity.
The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no 
rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.
Abjuration spells are protective in nature, though some 
of 
them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, 
negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures 
to other planes of existence.
Conjuration spells involve the transportation of objects 
and creatures from one location to another. Some spells 
summon creatures or objects to the caster’s side, whereas 
others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some 
conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.
Divination spells reveal information, whether in the form of 
secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations 
of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of 
distant people or places.
Enchantment spells affect the minds of others, influencing 
or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies 
see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of 
action, or even control another creature like a puppet.
Evocation spells manipulate magical energy to produce a 
desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others 
channel positive energy to heal wounds.
Illusion spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They 
cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things 
that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember 
things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom 
images that any creature can see, but the most insidious 
illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.
Necromancy spells manipulate the energies of life and 
death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, 
drain the life energy from another creature, create the 
undead, or even bring the dead back to life.
Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells 
such as animate dead is not a good act, and only evil casters 
use such spells frequently.
Transmutation spells change the properties of a creature, 
object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a 
harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an 
object move at the caster’s command, or enhance a creature’s 
innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.
Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t 
interfere with concentration. The following factors can 
break concentration:
•
 Casting another spell that requires concentration.
You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another 
spell that requires concentration. You can’t concen­
trate on two spells at once.
•
 Taking damage. Whenever you take damage while 
you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a 
Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentra­
tion. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, 
whichever number is higher. If you take damage from 
multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon’s 
breath, you make a separate saving throw for each 
source of damage.
•
 Being incapacitated or killed. You lose concentration 
on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.
The DM might also decide that certain environmental 
phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while 
you’re on a storm -tossed ship, require you to succeed 
on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain 
concentration on a spell.
T a r g e t s
A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets 
to be affected by the spell’s magic. A spell's description 
tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or 
a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).
Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature 
might not know it w as targeted by a spell at all. An effect 
like crackling lightning is obvious, but a m ore subtle 
effect, such as an attempt to read a creature’s thoughts, 
typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.
A  C l e a r  Pa t h  t o  t h e  T a r g e t
To target something, you must have a clear path to it, 
so it can’t be behind total cover.
If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t 
see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you 
and that point, the point o f origin com es into being on 
the near side of that obstruction.
T a r g e t i n g  Y o u r s e l f
If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can 
choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or 
specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the 
area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself.
A r e a s  o f  E f f e c t
Spells such as burning hands and cone of 
cold cover an 
area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.
A spell’s description specifies its area of effect, 
which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, 
cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has 
a point of origin, a location from which the spell’s 
energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you
position its point of origin. Typically, 
a point of origin is a point in space, but 
som e spells have an area w hose origin is a 
creature or an object.
A spell’s effect expands in straight lines from the point 
of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from  the 
point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that 
location isn’t included in the spell’s area. To block one of 
these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total 
cover, as explained in chapter 9.
C o n e
A cone extends in a direction you choose from  its point 
of origin. A cone’s width at a given point along its length 
is equal to that point’s distance from the point of origin. 
A cone’s area of effect specifies its maximum length.
A cone’s point of origin is not included in the cone’s 
area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.
C u b e
You select a cube’s point of origin, which lies anywhere 
on a face of the cubic effect. The cube’s size is expressed 
as the length of each side.
A cube’s point of origin is not included in the cube’s 
area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.
C y l i n d e r
A cylinder’s point of origin is the center of a circle of a 
particular radius, as given in the spell description. The 
circle must either be on the ground or at the height of 
the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in 
straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of 
the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell’s 
effect then shoots up from the base or down from the 
top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.
A cylinder’s point of origin is included in the cylinder’s 
area of effect.
L in e
A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path 
up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.
A line’s point of origin is not included in the line’s area 
of effect, unless you decide otherwise.
S p h e r e
You select a sphere’s point of origin, and the sphere 
extends outward from that point. The sphere’s 
size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends 
from the point.
A sphere’s point of origin is included in the sphere’s 
area of effect.
S a v i n g  T h r o w s
Many spells specify that a target can make a saving 
throw to avoid som e or all of a spell’s effects. The spell 
specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and 
what happens on a success or failure.
The DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your 
spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + 
any special modifiers.
A t t a c k  R o l l s
Som e spells require the caster to make an attack roll 
to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended 
target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your 
spellcasting ability m odifier + your proficiency bonus.
Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged 
attacks. Rem ember that you have disadvantage on a 
ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile 
creature that can see you and that isn’t incapacitated 
(see chapter 9).
C o m b i n i n g  M a g i c a l  E f f e c t s
The effects of different spells add together while 
the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of 
the same spell cast multiple times don't combine, 
however. Instead, the m ost potent effect—such as the 
highest bonus—from those castings applies while their 
durations overlap.
For example, if two clerics cast bless on the same 
target, that character gains the spell’s benefit only 
once; he or she doesn’t get to roll two bonus dice.
T h e  W e a v e  o f  M a g ic
The worlds within the D&D multiverse are magical places.
All existence is suffused with magical power, and potential 
energy lies untapped in every rock, stream, and living 
creature, and even in the air itself. Raw magic is the stuff of 
creation, the mute and mindless will of existence, permeating 
every bit of matter and present in every manifestation of 
energy throughout the multiverse.
Mortals can’t directly shape this raw magic. Instead, they 
make use of a fabric of magic, a kind of interface between 
the will of a spellcaster and the stuff of raw magic. The 
spellcasters of the Forgotten Realms call it the Weave and 
recognize its essence as the goddess Mystra, but casters 
have varied ways of naming and visualizing this interface. B
y 
any name, without the Weave, raw magic is locked away and 
inaccessible;the most powerful archmage can't light a candle 
with magic in an area where the Weave has been torn. But 
surrounded by the Weave, a spellcaster can shape lightning 
to blast foes, transport hundreds of miles in the blink of an 
eye, or even reverse death itself.
All magic depends on the Weave, though different kinds 
of magic access it in a variety of ways. The spells of wizards, 
warlocks, sorcerers, and bards are commonly called arcane 
magic. These spells rely on an understanding— learned or 
intuitive— of 
the workings of the Weave. The caster plucks 
directly at the strands of 
the Weave to create the desired 
effect. Eldritch knights and arcane tricksters also use arcane 
magic. The spells of clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers are 
called divine magic. These spellcasters’ access to the Weave 
is mediated by divine power— gods, the divine forces of 
nature, or the sacred weight of a paladin’s oath.
Whenever a magic effect is created, the threads of the 
Weave intertwine, twist, and fold to make the effect possible. 
When characters use divination spells such as detect magic or 
identify, they glimpse the Weave. A spell such as dispel magic 
smooths the Weave. Spells such as antimagic 
field rearrange 
the Weave so that magic flows around, rather than through, 
the area affected by the spell. And in places where the Weave 
is damaged or torn, magic works in unpredictable ways— or 
not at all.

fine silver wire)

Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Self 
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1
 hour
You assume a different form. W hen you cast the spell,

walking speed.
Change Appearance. You transform your appearance. 
You decide what you look like, including your height, 
weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, 
coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any.
You can make yourself appear as a m em ber of another 
race, though none of your statistics change. You also 
can’t appear as a creature of a different size than you,

you can’t use this spell to becom e quadrupedal, for 
instance. At any time for the duration of the spell, you

Duration: 24 hours

com panions harms the target, the spells ends.
At Higher Levels. W hen you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one 
additional beast for each slot level above 1st.
A n i m a l  M e s s e n g e r  
2nd-level enchantment (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a m orsel of food)
Duration: 24 hours
By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a 
message. C hoose a Tiny beast you can see within range, 
such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a 
location, which you must have visited, and a recipient 
who matches a general description, such as “a man or 
wom an dressed in the uniform of the town guard” or “a 
red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat.” You also speak 
a m essage of up to twenty-five words. The target beast 
travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified
location, covering about 50 m iles per 24 hours for a 
flying messenger, or 25 m iles for other animals.
W hen the m essenger arrives, it delivers your m essage 
to the creature that you described, replicating the sound 
of your voice. The m essenger speaks only to a creature 
matching the description you gave. If the m essenger 
doesn’t reach its destination before the spell ends, the 
m essage is lost, and the beast makes its way back to 
where you cast this spell.
At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 3nd level or higher, the duration of the spell 
increases by 48 hours for each slot level above 2nd.
A n i m a l  S h a p e s
8 th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 30 feet 
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 24 hours
Your m agic turns others into beasts. C hoose any 
number of willing creatures that you can see within 
range. You transform each target into the form  o f a 
Large or smaller beast with a challenge rating of 4 or 
lower. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to 
transform affected creatures into new forms.
The transformation lasts for the duration for each 
target, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. 
You can choose a different form for each target. A 
target’s game statistics are replaced by the statistics of 
the chosen beast, though the target retains its alignment 
and Intelligence, W isdom , and Charisma scores. The 
target assum es the hit points o f its new form, and when 
it reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number 
of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as 
a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage 
carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess 
damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 
hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious. The creature is 
limited in the actions it can perform  by the nature of its 
new form, and it can’t speak or cast spells.
The target’s gear melds into the new form. The target 
can’t activate, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of 
its equipment.
A n i m a t e  D e a d  
3rd-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 minute 
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, 
and a pinch of bone dust)
Duration: Instantaneous
This spell creates an undead servant. C hoose a pile 
of bones or a corpse of a M edium or Sm all humanoid 
within range. Your spell im bues the target with a foul 
mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The 
target becom es a skeleton if you chose bones or a 
zom bie if you chose a corpse (the DM has the creature’s 
game statistics).
On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action 
to mentally com m and any creature you made with 
this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you
control multiple creatures, you can com m and any or all 
of them at the sam e time, issuing the sam e com m and to 
each one). You decide what action the creature will take 
and where it w ill move during its next turn, or you can 
issue a general com m and, such as to guard a particular 
cham ber or corridor. If you issue no com m ands, the 
creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. 
Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it 
until its task is complete.
The creature is under your control for 24 hours, 
after which it stops obeying any com m and you’ve given 
it. To maintain control of the creature for another 
24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature 
again before the current 24-hour period ends. This 
use o f the spell reasserts your control over up to four 
creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than 
animating a new one.
A t Higher Levels. W hen you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert 
control over two additional undead creatures for each 
slot level above 3rd. Each of the creatures must com e 
from  a different corpse or pile of bones.
A n i m a t e  O b j e c t s
5th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 120 feet 
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Objects com e to life at your com m and. Choose up to 
ten nonm agical objects within range that are not being 
worn or carried. Medium targets count as two objects, 
Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets 
count as eight objects. You can’t animate any object 
larger than Huge. Each target animates and becom es a 
creature under your control until the spell ends or until 
reduced to 0 hit points.
As a bonus action, you can mentally com m and any 
creature you made with this spell if the creature is 
within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, 
you can com m and any or all of them at the same time, 
issuing the same com m and to each one). You decide 
what action the creature w ill take and where it will 
move during its next turn, or you can issue a general 
com m and, such as to guard a particular cham ber or 
corridor. If you issue no com m ands, the creature only 
defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given 
an order, the creature continues to follow it until its 
task is complete.

An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, 
attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size. 
Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and W isdom
are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet; if the 
object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for 
locom otion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and 
can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface 
or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its 
speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and 
is blind beyond that distance. W hen the animated object 
drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object 
form, and any remaining damage carries over to its 
original object form.
If you com m and an object to attack, it can make a 
single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet 
of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and 
bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The DM 
might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or 
piercing damage based on its form.
At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can animate two 
additional objects for each slot level above 5th.

5th-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Self (10-foot radius)
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
A shim mering barrier extends out from  you in a 10-foot 
radius and m oves with you, remaining centered on 
you and hedging out creatures other than undead and 
constructs. The barrier lasts for the duration.
The barrier prevents an affected creature from 
passing or reaching through. An affected creature 
can cast spells or make attacks with ranged or reach 
w eapons through the barrier.
If you move so that an affected creature is forced to 
pass through the barrier, the spell ends.
A n t i m a g i c  F i e l d
8 th-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (10-foot-radius sphere)
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron or
iron filings)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
A  10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds 
you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that 
suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can’t 
be cast, sum m oned creatures disappear, and even m agic 
items becom e mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere 
m oves with you, centered on you.
Spells and other magical effects, except those created 
by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere 
and can’t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast 
a suppressed spell is consum ed. W hile an effect is 
suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends 
suppressed counts against its duration.
Targeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects, 
such as magic missile and charm person, that target 
a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect 
on that target.
Areas of 
Magic. The area of another spell or magical 
effect, such as fireball, can’t extend into the sphere.
If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of 
the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed.
For example, the flames created by a wall o f 
fire are 
suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall 
if the overlap is large enough.
Spells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a 
creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while 
the creature or object is in it.
Magic Items. The properties and powers of 
m agic items are suppressed in the sphere. For 
example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a 
nonm agical longsword.
A m agic w eapon’s properties and powers are 
suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or 
wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon 
or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere 
(for example, if you fire a m agic arrow or throw a magic 
spear at a target outside the sphere), the m agic of the 
item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.
Magical Travel. Teleportation and planar travel 
fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the 
destination or the departure point for such magical 
travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of 
existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional 
space such as that created by the rope trick spell, 
temporarily closes while in the sphere.
Creatures and Objects. A creature or object 
sum m oned or created by m agic temporarily winks out 
of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly 
reappears once the space the creature occupied is no 
longer within the sphere.
Dispel Magic. Spells and magical effects such as 
dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the 
spheres created by different antimagic field spells don’t 
nullify each other.
A n t i p a t h y / S y m p a t h y  
8 th-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 hour 
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (either a lump of alum soaked in 
vinegar for the antipathy effect or a drop of honey for 
the sympathy effect)
Duration: 10 days
This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. 
You target som ething within range, either a Huge or 
smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger 
than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent 
creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires.
You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or 
repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose 
antipathy or sympathy as the aura’s effect.
Antipathy. The enchantment causes creatures of the 
kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the 
area and avoid the target. W hen such a creature can 
see the target or com es within 60 feet of it, the creature 
must succeed on a W isdom  saving throw or becom e 
frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can 
see the target or is within 60 feet of it. W hile frightened 
by the target, the creature must use its movement to
move to the nearest safe spot from  which it can’t see 
the target. If the creature m oves m ore than 60 feet from 
the target and can’t see it, the creature is no longer 
frightened, but the creature becom es frightened again if 
it regains sight of the target or m oves within 60 feet o f it.
Sympathy. The enchantment causes the specified 
creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target 
while within 60 feet o f it or able to see it. W hen such a 
creature can see the target or com es within 60 feet of it, 
the creature must succeed on a W isdom  saving throw or 
use its movement on each o f its turns to enter the area 
or move within reach of the target. W hen the creature 
has done so, it can’t willingly move away from  the target.
If the target dam ages or otherwise harms an affected 
creature, the affected creature can make a W isdom  
saving throw to end the effect, as described below.
Ending the Effect. If an affected creature ends its 
turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see 
it, the creature makes a W isdom  saving throw. On a 
successful save, the creature is no longer affected by 
the target and recognizes the feeling o f repugnance or 
attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by 
the spell is allowed another W isdom  saving throw every 
24 hours while the spell persists.
A creature that successfully saves against this effect 
is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be 
affected again.

4th-level divination
Casting Time: 1 action

You mentally receive visual information from the eye, 
which has normal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet. 
The eye can look in every direction.
As an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in 
any direction. There is no limit to how far away from 
you the eye can move, but it can’t enter another plane 
o f existence. A solid barrier blocks the eye’s movement, 
but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1
 
inch in diameter.

6 th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 500 feet 
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create linked teleportation portals that remain open 
for the duration. C hoose two points on the ground that 
you can see, one point within 10 feet of you and one 
point within 500 feet of you. A circular portal, 10 feet 
in diameter, opens over each point. If the portal would 
open in the space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, 
and the casting is lost.
The portals are two-dimensional glowing rings 
filled with mist, hovering inches from the ground and
perpendicular to it at the points you choose. A ring is 
visible only from one side (your choice), which is the side 
that functions as a portal.
Any creature or object entering the portal exits from 
the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each 
other; passing through a portal from  the nonportal side 
has no effect. The mist that fills each portal is opaque 
and blocks vision through it. On your turn, you can 
rotate the rings as a bonus action so that the active side 
faces in a different direction.

9th-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 hour 
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, S, M (for each creature you affect with 
this spell, you must provide one jacinth worth at least
1,000 
gp and one ornately carved bar of silver worth 
at least 100 gp, all of which the spell consum es) 
Duration: Special
You and up to eight willing creatures within range 
project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the 
spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already 
on that plane). The material body you leave behind is 
unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it 
doesn’t need food or air and doesn’t age.
Your astral body resem bles your m ortal form in 
almost every way, replicating your game statistics and 
possessions. The principal difference is the addition of 
a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder 
blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after
1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As 
long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way 
home. If the cord is cut—som ething that can happen 
only when an effect specifically states that it does—your 
soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.
Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral 
Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any 
other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the 
plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and 
possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing 
you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane.
Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage 
or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your 
physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.
The spell ends for you and your com panions when 
you use your action to dismiss it. W hen the spell ends, 
the affected creature returns to its physical body, 
and it awakens.
The spell might also end early for you or one o f your 
com panions. A successful dispel magic spell used 
against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that 
creature. If a creature’s original body or its astral form 
drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If 
the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls 
the creature’s astral form back to its body, ending its 
state of suspended animation.
If you are returned to your body prematurely, your 
com panions remain in their astral form s and must find 
their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping 
to 0 hit points.

cover against the target. The target can't move through 
the hand’s space if its Strength score is less than or

creature dies, its soul transfers to the clone, provided 
that the soul is free and willing to return. The clone is 
physically identical to the original and has the same 
personality, m em ories, and abilities, but none of the 
original’s equipment. The original creature’s physical 
remains, if they still exist, becom e inert and can’t

You contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to 
three questions that can be answered with a yes or no. 
You must ask your questions before the spell ends. You 
receive a correct answer for each question.
Divine beings aren’t necessarily omniscient, so you 
might receive “unclear” as an answer if a question 
pertains to information that lies beyond the deity’s 
knowledge. In a case w here a one-word answer could be 
misleading or contrary to the deity’s interests, the DM 
might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.
If you cast the spell two or m ore times before finishing 
your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent 
chance for each casting after the first that you get no 
answer. The DM makes this roll in secret.

such as “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,” “irrelevant,” or 
“unclear” (if the entity doesn’t know the answer to the 
question). If a one-word answer would be misleading, 
the DM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer.

5th-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Touch 
Component: V, S 
Duration: 7 days
Your touch inflicts disease. Make a melee spell attack 
against a creature within your reach. On a hit, you afflict 
the creature with a disease of your choice from any of 
the ones described below.
At the end of each of the target’s turns, it must make 
a Constitution saving throw. After failing three of 
these saving throws, the disease’s effects last for the 
duration, and the creature stops making these saves. 
After succeeding on three of these saving throws, the 
creature recovers from the disease, and the spell ends.
Since this spell induces a natural disease in its 
target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise 
ameliorates a disease’s effects apply to it.
Blinding Sickness. Pain grips the creature’s mind, 
and its eyes turn milky white. The creature has 
disadvantage on W isdom  checks and W isdom  saving 
throws and is blinded.
Filth Fever. A raging fever sw eeps through the 
creature’s body. The creature has disadvantage on 
Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and attack 
rolls that use Strength.
Flesh Rot. The creature’s flesh decays. The creature 
has disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability 
to all damage.
Mindfire. The creature’s mind becom es feverish. The 
creature has disadvantage on Intelligence checks and 
Intelligence saving throws, and the creature behaves as 
if under the effects of the confusion spell during combat.
Seizure. The creature is overcom e with shaking.
The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity checks,
 
Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls that 
use Dexterity.
Slimy 
Doom. The creature begins to bleed 
uncontrollably. The creature has disadvantage on 
Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws.
In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, it is 
stunned until the end of its next turn.

6 th-level evocation
Casting Time: 10 minutes 
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a statuette of yourself carved 
from ivory and decorated with gems worth at 
least 1,500 gp)
Duration: 10 days
Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that 
has a casting time of 1
 action, and that can target you. 
You cast that spell—called the contingent spell—as part 
of casting contingency, expending spell slots for both, but 
the contingent spell doesn't com e into effect. Instead, it 
takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You 
describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. 
For example, a contingency cast with water breathing 
might stipulate that water breathing com es into effect 
when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.
The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the 
circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you 
want it to. and then contingency ends.
The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even 
if it can normally target others. You can use only one 
contingency spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, 
the effect of another contingency spell on you ends. Also, 
contingency ends on you if its material com ponent is 
ever not on your person.

4th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1
 action 
Range: 300 feet
Components: V, S , M (a drop of water and a 
pinch of dust)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Until the spell ends, you control any freestanding water 
inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet 
on a side. You can choose from any of the following 
effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your 
turn, you can repeat the sam e effect or choose a 
different one.
Flood. You cause the water level of all standing water in 
the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes 
a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.
If you choose an area in a large body of water, you 
instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from  one 
side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any 
Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path are carried 
with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles 
struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.
The water level remains elevated until the spell ends 
or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced
a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn 
while the flood effect lasts.
Part Water. You cause water in the area to move 
apart and create a trench. The trench extends across 
the spell’s area, and the separated water form s a wall to 
either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or 
you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills 
in the trench over the course of the next round until the 
normal water level is restored.
R edirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the area 
to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has 
to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely 
directions. The water in the area m oves as you direct 
it, but once it m oves beyond the spell’s area, it resumes 
its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water 
continues to move in the direction you chose until the 
spell ends or you choose a different effect.
Whirlpool. This effect requires a body of water 
at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause 
a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The 
whirlpool form s a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the 
base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any 
creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the 
vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim 
away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) 
check against your spell save DC.
W hen a creature enters the vortex for the first time on 
a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength 
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 
bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until 
the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes 
half damage, and isn’t caught in the vortex. A creature 
caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim 
away from the vortex as described above, but has 
disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.
The first time each turn that an object enters the 
vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this 
damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.

weather conditions, which are determined by the DM 
based on the climate and season. You can change 
precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d4 x 10 
minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once they 
do so, you can change the conditions again. W hen the 
spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.
W hen you change the weather conditions, find a 
current condition on the following tables and change its 
stage by one, up or down. W hen changing the wind, you

within 30 feet of the ammunition for the first time on a 
turn or ends its turn there, one piece of ammunition flies 
up to strike it. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity 
saving throw or take 1d6 piercing damage. The piece of 
ammunition is then destroyed. The spell ends when no 
ammunition remains.

Duration: Instantaneous
You can cast this spell only at night. C hoose up to three 
corpses of M edium or Sm all humanoids within range. 
Each corpse becom es a ghoul under your control. (The 
DM has game statistics for these creatures.)
As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can 
mentally com m and any creature you animated with 
this spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you (if you 
control multiple creatures, you can com m and any or all 
of them at the sam e time, issuing the same com m and to 
each one). You decide what action the creature w ill take 
and w here it will move during its next turn, or you can 
issue a general com m and, such as to guard a particular 
cham ber or corridor. If you issue no com m ands, the 
creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. 
Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it 
until its task is complete.
The creature is under your control for 24 hours, 
after which it stops obeying any com m and you have 
given it. To maintain control of the creature for another
24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature 
before the current 24-hour period ends. This use 
of the spell reasserts your control over up to three 
creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than 
animating new ones.

7th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control 
over four ghouls. W hen you cast this spell using an

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
For the duration, you can read the thoughts o f certain 
creatures. W hen you cast the spell and as your action on 
each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind 
on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of 
you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of
3 or lower or doesn’t speak any language, the creature 
is unaffected.
You initially learn the surface thoughts of the 
creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As 
an action, you can either shift your attention to another 
creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the 
sam e creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target 
must make a W isdom  saving throw. If it fails, you gain 
insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, 
and som ething that loom s large in its mind (such as 
som ething it w orries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, 
the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are 
probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention 
to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use 
its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check 
contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, 
the spell ends.
Questions verbally directed at the target creature 
naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell 
is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.
You can also use this spell to detect the presence of 
thinking creatures you can’t see. W hen you cast the 
spell or as your action during the duration, you can 
search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can 
penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches o f any 
metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. 
You can’t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or 
lower or one that doesn’t speak any language.
Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, 
you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as 
described above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still 
be within range.

1st-level illusion
Casting Time: 1
 action 
Range: Self 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 1 hour
You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, 
weapons, and other belongings on your person—look 
different until the spell ends or until you use your action 
to dism iss it. You can seem  1 foot shorter or taller and 
can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change 
your body type, so you must adopt a form  that has the 
sam e basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent 
of the illusion is up to you.
The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to 
physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell 
to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, 
and anyone w ho touches it w ould feel nothing or would 
feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear 
thinner than you are, the hand of som eone who reaches 
out to touch you would bump into you while it was 
seem ingly still in midair.
To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use 
its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed 
on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your 
spell save DC.

A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a 
target that you can see within range. The target can be a 
creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such 
as the wall created by wall o f 
force.
A creature targeted by this spell must make a 
Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 
10d6 + 40 force damage. If this damage reduces the 
target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.
A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing 
and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile 
of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life 
only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell.
This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or 
smaller nonm agical object or a creation of magical 
force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation 
of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of 
it. A m agic item is unaffected by this spell.

Duration: Until dispelled
You touch an object weighing 10 pounds or less w hose 
longest dim ension is 6 feet or less. The spell leaves an 
invisible mark on its surface and invisibly inscribes the 
name of the item on the sapphire you use as the material 
component. Each time you cast this spell, you must use

At any time thereafter, you can use your action to 
speak the item’s name and crush the sapphire. The item 
instantly appears in your hand regardless of physical or 
planar distances, and the spell ends.
If another creature is holding or carrying the item, 
crushing the sapphire doesn’t transport the item to you,

object is and roughly where that creature is located 
at that moment.

This spell shapes a creature’s dreams. Choose a 
creature known to you as the target of this spell. The 
target must be on the same plane of existence as you. 
Creatures that don’t sleep, such as elves, can’t be 
contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you 
touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger. 
W hile in the trance, the m essenger is aware of his or 
her surroundings, but can’t take actions or move.
If the target is asleep, the m essenger appears in the 
target’s dream s and can converse with the target as 
long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the 
spell. The m essenger can also shape the environment 
of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other 
images. The m essenger can emerge from the trance at 
any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target 
recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is 
awake when you cast the spell, the m essenger knows it, 
and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for 
the target to fall asleep, at which point the m essenger 
appears in the target’s dreams.
You can make the m essenger appear monstrous 
and terrifying to the target. If you do, the m essenger 
can deliver a m essage of no m ore than ten words and 
then the target must make a W isdom  saving throw. On 
a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity 
spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target’s 
sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit 
from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it 
takes 3d6 psychic damage.
If you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a 
nail, or similar portion of the target’s body, the target 
m akes its saving throw with disadvantage.

You create a seism ic disturbance at a point on the 
ground that you can see within range. For the duration, 
an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 
100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes 
creatures and structures in contact with the ground 
in that area.
The ground in the area becom es difficult terrain.
Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must 
make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the 
creature’s concentration is broken.
W hen you cast this spell and at the end of each turn 
you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the 
ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. 
On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.
This spell can have additional effects depending on 
the terrain in the area, as determined by the DM.
Fissures. Fissures open throughout the spell’s area at 
the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total 
of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM. 
Each is 1d10 x 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends 
from one edge of the spell’s area to the opposite side.
A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens 
must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A 
creature that successfully saves m oves with the fissure’s 
edge as it opens.
A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to 
automatically collapse (see below).
Structures. The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage 
to any structure in contact with the ground in the area 
when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your 
turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit 
points, it collapses and potentially dam ages nearby 
creatures. A creature within half the distance of a 
structure’s height must make a Dexterity saving throw. 
On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning 
damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, 
requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an 
action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher 
or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On 
a successful save, the creature takes half as much 
damage and doesn’t fall prone or becom e buried.

You cause a creature or an object you can see within 
range to grow larger or smaller for the duration. Choose 
either a creature or an object that is neither worn 
nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a 
Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell 
has no effect.
If the target is a creature, everything it is w earing and 
carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an 
affected creature returns to normal size at once.
Enlarge. The target’s size doubles in all dimensions, 
and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth 
increases its size by one category—from Medium to 
Large, for example. If there isn’t enough room  for the 
target to double its size, the creature or object attains 
the maximum possible size in the space available.
Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on 
Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The 
target’s w eapons also grow to match its new size. W hile 
these weapons are enlarged, the target’s attacks with 
them deal 1d4 extra damage.
Reduce. The target’s size is halved in all dimensions, 
and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This 
reduction decreases its size by one category—from 
Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, 
the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks 
and Strength saving throws. The target’s weapons also 
shrink to match its new size. W hile these w eapons are 
reduced, the target’s attacks with them deal 1d4 less 
damage (this can’t reduce the damage below  1).

You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an 
animal form you choose: bat, cat, crab, frog (toad), hawk, 
lizard, octopus, owl, poisonous snake, fish (quipper), 
rat, raven, sea horse, spider, or weasel. Appearing in 
an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the 
statistics o f the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, 
or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.
Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always 
obeys your com m ands. In combat, it rolls its own 
initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can’t 
attack, but it can take other actions as normal.
W hen the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, 
leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you 
cast this spell again 
W hile your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you 
can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, 
as an action, you can see through your familiar’s eyes 
and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, 
gaining the benefits of any special senses that the 
familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind 
with regard to your own senses.
As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your 
familiar. It disappears into a pocket dim ension where it 
awaits your sum m ons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it 
forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed,
you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space 
within 30 feet of you.
You can’t have m ore than one familiar at a time. If you 
cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you 
instead cause it to adopt a new form. C hoose one of the 
form s from the above list. Your familiar transforms into 
the chosen creature.
Finally, when you cast a spell with a range o f touch, 
your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the 
spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and 
it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast 
it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack 
modifier for the roll.

a mastiff. (Your DM might allow other animals to be 
sum m oned as steeds.) The steed has the statistics of the 
chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your 
choice) instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your 
steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence 
becom es 6, and it gains the ability to understand one 
language of your choice that you speak.
Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and 
out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows 
you to fight as a seam less unit. W hile mounted on your 
steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only 
you also target your steed.
W hen the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, 
leaving behind no physical form. You can also 
dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing 
it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell 
again sum m ons the same steed, restored to its hit 
point maximum.
W hile your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can 
com m unicate with it telepathically.
You can’t have m ore than one steed bonded by this

which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can 
orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal 
lasts for the duration.
The portal has a front and a back on each plane where 
it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only 
by moving through its front. Anything that does so is 
instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in 
the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.
Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals 
created by this spell from opening in their presence or 
anywhere within their domains.
W hen you cast this spell, you can speak the name 
of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname 
doesn’t work). If that creature is on a plane other than 
the one you are on, the portal opens in the named 
creature’s immediate vicinity and draws the creature 
through it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side 
of the portal. You gain no special power over the creature, 
and it is free to act as the DM deem s appropriate. It 
might leave, attack you, or help you.

5th-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 minute 
Range: 60 feet 
Components: V 
Duration: 30 days
You place a magical com m and on a creature that you 
can see within range, forcing it to carry out som e
service or refrain from som e action or course of activity 
as you decide. If the creature can understand you, it 
must succeed on a W isdom  saving throw or becom e 
charm ed by you for the duration. W hile the creature 
is charm ed by you, it takes 5d10 psychic damage 
each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your 
instructions, but no m ore than once each day. A creature 
that can't understand you is unaffected by the spell.
You can issue any com m and you choose, short of an 
activity that would result in certain death. Should you 
issue a suicidal com m and, the spell ends.
You can end the spell early by using an action to 
dism iss it. A remove curse, greater restoration, or wish 
spell also ends it.
A t Higher Levels. W hen you cast this spell using 
a spell slot o f 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year. 
W hen you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, 
the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells 
mentioned above.

Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of salt and one copper

remain there for the duration)
Duration: 10 days
You touch a corpse or other remains. For the 
duration, the target is protected from  decay and can’t 
becom e undead.
The spell also effectively extends the time limit on 
raising the target from the dead, since days spent under 
the influence of this spell don’t count against the time 
limit o f spells such as raise dead.

4th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 30 feet 
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five 
wasps, or one scorpion within range into giant versions 
of their natural form s for the duration. A centipede 
becom es a giant centipede, a spider becom es a giant 
spider, a wasp becom es a giant wasp, and a scorpion 
becom es a giant scorpion.
Each creature obeys your verbal com m ands, and 
in combat, they act on your turn each round. The DM 
has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their 
actions and movement.
A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, 
until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you use an action to 
dism iss the effect on it.
The DM might allow you to choose different targets. 
For example, if you transform a bee, its giant version 
might have the sam e statistics as a giant wasp.

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
An immobile, faintly shim m ering barrier springs into 
existence in a 10-foot radius around you and remains for 
the duration.
Any spell of 5th level or lower cast from outside the 
barrier can't affect creatures or objects within it, even 
if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot. Such a 
spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, 
but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area 
within the barrier is excluded from  the areas affected 
by such spells.
A t Higher Levels. W hen you cast this spell using a

3rd-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 hour 
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond 
worth at least 200 gp, which the spell consum es) 
Duration: Until dispelled or triggered
W hen you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that 
harms other creatures, either upon a surface (such as 
a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object 
that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure 
chest) to conceal the glyph. If you choose a surface, the 
glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 
10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object 
must remain in its place; if the object is m oved m ore 
than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is 
broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.
The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful 
Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save 
DC to be found.
You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast 
the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most 
typical triggers include touching or standing on the 
glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, 
approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or 
manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. 
For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most com m on
triggers include opening that object, approaching within 
a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the 
glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.
You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates 
only under certain circum stances or according to 
physical characteristics (such as height or weight), 
creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to 
affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also 
set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, 
such as those w ho say a certain password.
W hen you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes 
or a spell glyph.
Explosive Runes. W hen triggered, the glyph erupts 
with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered 
on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each 
creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving 
throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or 
thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice 
when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a 
successful one.
Spell Glyph. You can store a prepared spell of 
3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part 
of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single 
creature or an area. The spell being stored has no 
immediate effect when cast in this way. W hen the glyph 
is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a 
target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph.
If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on 
that creature. If the spell sum m ons hostile creatures 
or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as 
close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the 
spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its 
full duration.
A t Higher Levels. W hen you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an 
explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot 
level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store 
any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for 
the glyph o f 
warding.

You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet 
of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 
5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The 
warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you 
desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by 
dividing the area am ong them, as long as you can walk 
into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.
W hen you cast this spell, you can specify individuals 
that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that 
you choose. You can also specify a password that, 
when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to 
these effects.
Guards and wards creates the following effects within 
the warded area.
Corridors. Fog fills all the warded corridors, making 
them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection 
or branching passage offering a choice of direction, 
there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than 
you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from 
the one it chooses.
Doors. All doors in the warded area are magically 
locked, as if sealed by an arcane lock spell. In addition, 
you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent 
to the illusory object function of the minor illusion spell) 
to make them appear as plain sections of wall.
Stairs. W ebs fill all stairs in the warded area from top 
to bottom, as the web spell. These strands regrow in 10 
minutes if they are burned or torn away while guards 
and wards lasts.
Other Spell Effect. You can place your choice of one 
of the following magical effects within the warded area 
of the stronghold.
•
 Place dancing lights in four corridors. You can desig­
nate a simple program  that the lights repeat as long as 
guards and wards lasts.
•
 Place magic mouth in two locations.
•
 Place stinking cloud in two locations. The vapors 
appear in the places you designate; they return within 
10 minutes if dispersed by wind while guards and 
wards lasts.
•
 Place a constant gust of 
wind in one corridor or room.
•
 Place a suggestion in one location. You select an area 
of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters 
or passes through the area receives the suggestion 
mentally.
The whole w arded area radiates magic. A dispel 
magic cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes 
only that effect.
You can create a permanently guarded and warded 
structure by casting this spell there every day 
for one year.

You touch a point and infuse an area around it with holy 
(or unholy) power. The area can have a radius up to 60 
feet, and the spell fails if the radius includes an area 
already under the effect a hallow spell. The affected area 
is subject to the following effects.

entering the area. You can exclude one or m ore of those 
types of creatures from this effect.

effect offered by the DM. Som e of these effects apply to 
creatures in the area; you can designate whether the

have resistance to one damage type of your choice, 
except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.

have vulnerability to one damage type of your choice, 
except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.

Duration: 24 hours
You make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range 
look, sound, and smell like som e other sort of natural 
terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to 
resem ble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or som e other difficult 
or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem  
like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, 
or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and sm ooth road. 
Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures 
within the area aren’t changed in appearance.
The tactile characteristics of the terrain are 
unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to 
see through the illusion. If the difference isn’t obvious 
by touch, a creature carefully exam ining the illusion can 
attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against 
your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who 
discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague 
image superim posed on the terrain.

Duration: Until dispelled
You create a magical restraint to hold a creature that 
you can see within range. The target must succeed on 
a W isdom  saving throw or be bound by the spell; if it 
succeeds, it is immune to this spell if you cast it again. 
W hile affected by this spell, the creature doesn't need 
to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn’t age. Divination 
spells can’t locate or perceive the target.
W hen you cast the spell, you choose one of the 
following form s of imprisonment.
Burial. The target is entombed far beneath the earth 
in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to 
contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, 
nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get 
into or out of it.
The special com ponent for this version of the spell is a 
small mithral orb.
Chaining. Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, 
hold the target in place. The target is restrained until 
the spell ends, and it can’t move or be moved by any 
means until then.
The special com ponent for this version of the spell is a 
fine chain of precious metal.
Hedged Prison. The spell transports the target into 
a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation 
and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a 
cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area 
of your choice.
The special com ponent for this version of the spell is a 
miniature representation of the prison made from jade.
Minimus Containment. The target shrinks to a height 
of 1 inch and is im prisoned inside a gemstone or similar
object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally 
(allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see 
in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of 
teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can’t be cut 
or broken while the spell remains in effect.
The special com ponent for this version of the spell 
is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, 
diamond, or ruby.
Slumber. The target falls asleep and can’t be awoken. 
The special com ponent for this version of the spell 
consists o f rare soporific herbs.
Ending the Spell. During the casting of the spell, 
in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that 
will cause the spell to end and release the target. The 
condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you 
choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is 
reasonable and has a likelihood of com ing to pass. The 
conditions can be based on a creature’s name, identity, 
or deity but otherwise must be based on observable 
actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as 
level, class, or hit points.
A  dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast 
as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the 
special com ponent used to create it.
You can use a particular special com ponent to create 
only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again 
using the same component, the target of the first casting 
is immediately freed from its binding.

be possessed). The target must make a Charisma saving 
throw. On a failure, your soul m oves into the target’s 
body, and the target’s soul becom es trapped in the 
container. On a success, the target resists your efforts 
to possess it, and you can’t attempt to possess it again 
for 24 hours.
Once you possess a creature’s body, you control it. 
Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the 
creature, though you retain your alignment and your 
Intelligence, W isdom , and Charisma scores. You retain 
the benefit of your own class features. If the target has 
any class levels, you can’t use any of its class features.
Meanwhile, the possessed creature’s soul can 
perceive from the container using its own senses, but it 
can’t move or take actions at all.
W hile possessing a body, you can use your action to 
return from the host body to the container if it is within 
100 feet of you, returning the host creature’s soul to 
its body. If the host body dies while you’re in it, the 
creature dies, and you must make a Charisma saving 
throw against your own spellcasting DC. On a success, 
you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you. 
Otherwise, you die.
If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your 
soul immediately returns to your body. If your body is 
more than 100 feet away from you or if your body is 
dead when you attempt to return to it, you die. If another 
creature’s soul is in the container when it is destroyed, 
the creature’s soul returns to its body if the body is alive 
and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature dies.
W hen the spell ends, the container is destroyed.

Duration: Until dispelled
You implant a m essage within an object in range, a 
m essage that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. 
Choose an object that you can see and that isn’t being 
worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the 
message, which must be 25 words or less, though it 
can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, 
determine the circum stance that will trigger the spell to 
deliver your message.
W hen that circum stance occurs, a magical mouth 
appears on the object and recites the m essage in your 
voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object 
you chose has a mouth or som ething that looks like a 
mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical 
mouth appears there so that the w ords appear to com e 
from  the object’s mouth. W hen you cast this spell, you 
can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or 
it can remain and repeat its m essage whenever the 
trigger occurs.
The triggering circum stance can be as general or as 
detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual 
or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the 
object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to 
speak when any creature m oves within 30 feet of the 
object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.

3rd-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create the image of an object, a creature, or som e 
other visible phenom enon that is no larger than a 
20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you 
can see within range and lasts for the duration. It 
seem s completely real, including sounds, smells, and 
temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You 
can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a 
sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a 
creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a 
troglodyte’s stench).
As long as you are within range of the illusion, you 
can use your action to cause the image to move to 
any other spot within range. As the image changes 
location, you can alter its appearance so that its 
movements appear natural for the image. For example, 
if you create an im age of a creature and move it, you 
can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. 
Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different 
sounds at different times, even making it carry on a 
conversation, for example.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an 
illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature 
that uses its action to examine the image can determine 
that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence 
(Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a 
creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature 
can see through the image, and its other sensory 
qualities becom e faint to the creature.
At Higher Levels. W hen you cast this spell using

Duration: 24 hours
You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence 
or two) and magically influence up to twelve creatures 
of your choice that you can see within range and that 
can hear and understand you. Creatures that can’t be 
charm ed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must 
be w orded in such a manner as to make the course of 
action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab 
itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do 
som e other obviously harmful act automatically negates 
the effect of the spell.
Each target must make a W isdom  saving throw. On a 
failed save, it pursues the course of action you described 
to the best of its ability. The suggested course o f action 
can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested 
activity can be com pleted in a shorter time, the spell 
ends w hen the subject finishes what it was asked to do.
You can also specify conditions that will trigger a 
special activity during the duration. For example, you 
might suggest that a group of soldiers give all their 
money to the first beggar they meet. If the condition isn’t 
met before the spell ends, the activity isn’t perform ed.
If you or any of your com panions damage a creature 
affected by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.
At Higher Levels. W hen you cast this spell using 
a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is 10 days. W hen

You banish a creature that you can see within range into 
a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for 
the duration or until it escapes the maze.
The target can use its action to attempt to escape. 
W hen it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence check. If 
it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends (a minotaur or 
goristro dem on automatically succeeds).
When the spell ends, the target reappears in the 
space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest 
unoccupied space.

3rd-level transmutation (ritual)
Casting Time: 1
 action 
Range: Touch 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 8 hours
You step into a stone object or surface large enough to 
fully contain your body, melding yourself and all the 
equipment you carry with the stone for the duration. 
Using your movement, you step into the stone at a point 
you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible 
or otherwise detectable by nonm agical senses.
W hile merged with the stone, you can’t see what 
occurs outside it, and any W isdom  (Perception) checks 
you make to hear sounds outside it are made with 
disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of 
time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in 
the stone. You can use your movement to leave the 
stone where you entered it, which ends the spell. You 
otherwise can’t move.
Minor physical damage to the stone doesn’t harm 
you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape 
(to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you 
and deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage to you. The stone’s 
complete destruction (or transmutation into a different 
substance) expels you and deals 50 bludgeoning damage 
to you. If expelled, you fall prone in an unoccupied space 
closest to where you first entered.

Illusion cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 30 feet
Components: S, M (a bit of fleece)
Duration: 1 minute
You create a sound or an image of an object within 
range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if 
you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.
If you create a sound, its volume can range from a 
whisper to a scream . It can be your voice, som eone 
else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any 
other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated 
throughout the duration, or you can make discrete 
sounds at different times before the spell ends.
If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, 
muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger 
than a 5-foot cube. The image can’t create sound, light, 
smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction 
with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because 
things can pass through it.
If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or 
image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion 
with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check 
against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the 
illusion for what it is, the illusion becom es faint to 
the creature.

7th-level illusion
Casting Time: 10 minutes 
Range: Sight 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 10 days
You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square 
look, sound, smell, and even feel like som e other sort 
of terrain. The terrain’s general shape remains the 
same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to 
resem ble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or som e other difficult 
or im passable terrain. A pond can be made to seem  like 
a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a 
rock-strewn gully like a wide and sm ooth road.
Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, 
or add them where none are present. The spell doesn’t 
disguise, conceal, or add creatures.
The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and 
olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into 
difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede 
movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory 
terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from  the 
spell’s area disappears immediately.
Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion 
to the terrain’s true form; however, all other elements 
of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of
the illusion’s presence, the creature can still physically 
interact with the illusion.

Duration: 1 minute
Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your 
space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with 
you and m im ic your actions, shifting position so it’s 
im possible to track which image is real. You can use 
your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.
Each time a creature targets you with an attack during 
the spell’s duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the 
attack instead targets one of your duplicates.
If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or 
higher to change the attack’s target to a duplicate. With 
two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one 
duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.
A duplicate’s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier.
If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A 
duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it.
It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends 
when all three duplicates are destroyed.
A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can’t see, if it 
relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or 
if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.

5th-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 30 feet 
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You attempt to reshape another creature’s m em ories. 
One creature that you can see must make a W isdom  
saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has 
advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the 
target becom es charm ed by you for the duration. The 
charm ed target is incapacitated and unaware of its 
surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any 
damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, 
and none of the target’s m em ories are modified.
W hile this charm lasts, you can affect the target’s 
m em ory of an event that it experienced within the last 
24 hours and that lasted no m ore than 10 minutes. You 
can permanently eliminate all m em ory of the event, 
allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity 
and exacting detail, change its m em ory of the details of 
the event, or create a m em ory of som e other event.
You must speak to the target to describe how 
its m em ories are affected, and it must be able to 
understand your language for the modified m em ories to 
take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your 
description. If the spell ends before you have finished 
describing the modified m em ories, the creature’s 
m em ory isn’t altered. Otherwise, the modified m em ories 
take hold when the spell ends.
A m odified m em ory doesn’t necessarily affect how a 
creature behaves, particularly if the m em ory contradicts 
the creature’s natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. 
An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a 
m em ory of how  much the creature enjoyed dousing 
itself in acid, is dism issed, perhaps as a bad dream. The 
DM might deem  a modified m em ory too nonsensical to 
affect a creature in a significant manner.
A remove curse or greater restoration spell cast on the 
target restores the creature’s true memory.
A t Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target’s 
m em ories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago 
(6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), 
or any time in the creature’s past (9th level).

A silvery beam  of pale light shines down in a 5-foot- 
radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within 
range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.
W hen a creature enters the spell’s area for the first 
time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed 
in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must 
make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a 
successful one.
A shapechanger makes its saving throw with 
disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its 
original form and can’t assume a different form until it 
leaves the spell’s light.
On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can 
use an action to move the beam  60 feet in any direction.

The hound is invisible to all creatures except you

com es within 30 feet of it without first speaking the

hound starts barking loudly. The hound sees invisible 
creatures and can see into the Ethereal Plane. It

At the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts 
to bite one creature within 5 feet of it that is hostile

You make an area within range magically secure. The 
area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large 
as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration 
or until you use an action to dism iss it.
W hen you cast the spell, you decide what sort of 
security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the 
following properties:
•
 Sound can't pass through the barrier at the edge of 
the warded area.
•
 The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, 
preventing vision (including darkvision) through it.
•
 Sensors created by divination spells can’t appear 
inside the protected area or pass through the barrier 
at its perimeter.
•
 Creatures in the area can’t be targeted by divination 
spells.
•
 Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.
•
 Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.
Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a

you can see and repeat this attack against the same 
target or a different one.

6th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (an iron blade and a small bag 
containing a mixture of soils—clay, loam, and sand) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 2 hours
C hoose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a 
side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay 
in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. 
You can raise or lower the area’s elevation, create or fill 
in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The 
extent of any such changes can’t exceed half the area’s 
largest dimension. So, if you affect a 40-foot square, 
you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower 
the square’s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up 
to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these 
changes to complete.
At the end o f every 10 minutes you spend 
concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of 
terrain to affect.
Because the terrain’s transformation occurs slowly, 
creatures in the area can’t usually be trapped or injured 
by the ground’s movement.
This spell can’t manipulate natural stone or 
stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to 
accom m odate the new terrain. If the way you shape 
the terrain would make a structure unstable, it 
might collapse.
Similarly, this spell doesn’t directly affect plant 
growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it.

Duration: 8 hours
For the duration, you hide a target that you touch 
from  divination magic. The target can be a willing 
creature or a place or an object no larger than 10 
feet in any dimension. The target can’t be targeted by 
any divination magic or perceived through magical 
scrying sensors.

2nd-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a small square of silk)
Duration: 24 hours
You place an illusion on a creature or an object 
you touch so that divination spells reveal false 
information about it. The target can be a willing 
creature or an object that isn’t being carried or worn by 
another creature.
W hen you cast the spell, choose one or both of the 
following effects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you 
cast this spell on the sam e creature or object every day 
for 30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the 
illusion lasts until it is dispelled.
False Aura. You change the way the target appears 
to spells and magical effects, such as detect magic, 
that detect magical auras. You can make a nonm agical 
object appear magical, a magical object appear 
nonmagical, or change the object’s magical aura so that 
it appears to belong to a specific school of magic that 
you choose. W hen you use this effect on an object, you 
can make the false magic apparent to any creature that 
handles the item.
Mask. You change the way the target appears to spells 
and magical effects that detect creature types, such as a 
paladin’s Divine Sense or the trigger of a symbol spell. 
You choose a creature type and other spells and magical 
effects treat the target as if it were a creature of that 
type or of that alignment.

6th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 300 feet
Components: V, S, M (a small crystal sphere)
Duration: Instantaneous
A frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips 
to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes 
in a 60-foot-radius sphere. Each creature within the 
area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a 
failed save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a 
successful save, it takes half as much damage.
If the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is 
principally water (not including water-based creatures), 
it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area 
30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures 
that w ere swim m ing on the surface of frozen water are 
trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action 
to make a Strength check against your spell save DC 
to break free.
You can refrain from firing the globe after completing 
the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of 
a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand.
At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to 
can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it 
with a sling (to the sling’s normal range). It shatters 
on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting 
of the spell. You can also set the globe down without 
shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn’t already 
shattered, it explodes.
At Higher Levels. W hen you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 
1d6 for each slot level above 6th.

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
A sphere of shim m ering force encloses a creature 
or object of Large size or smaller within range. An 
unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving 
throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for 
the duration.
Nothing—not physical objects, energy, or other spell 
effects—can pass through the barrier, in or out, though 
a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere 
is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside 
can’t be damaged by attacks or effects originating from 
outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage 
anything outside it.
The sphere is weightless and just large enough to 
contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed 
creature can use its action to push against the sphere’s 
walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature’s 
speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved 
by other creatures.
A disintegrate spell targeting the globe destroys it 
without harming anything inside it.

Choose one creature that you can see within range. The 
target begins a com ic dance in place: shuffling, tapping 
its feet, and capering for the duration. Creatures that 
can’t be charm ed are immune to this spell.
A dancing creature must use all its movement to 
dance without leaving its space and has disadvantage 
on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls. W hile 
the target is affected by this spell, other creatures 
have advantage on attack rolls against it. As an 
action, a dancing creature makes a W isdom  saving 
throw to regain control of itself. On a successful save, 
the spell ends.

For the duration, each creature you choose within 30

means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves 
behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.

A passage appears at a point of your choice that you

a wall, a ceiling, or a floor) within range, and lasts for 
the duration. You choose the opening’s dimensions: up 
to 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage 
creates no instability in a structure surrounding it.
W hen the opening disappears, any creatures or 
objects still in the passage created by the spell are safely 
ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the surface on 
which you cast the spell.

2nd-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1
 minute
You craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a 
creature that you can see within range. The target must 
make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you 
create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible 
phenom enon of your choice that is no larger than a 
10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target 
for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead 
or constructs.
The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other 
stimuli, also evident only to the creature.
The target can use its action to examine the phantasm 
with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your 
spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes 
that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.
W hile a target is affected by the spell, the target treats 
the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes 
any illogical outcom es from interacting with the 
phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk 
across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls 
once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the 
fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and com es up 
with som e other explanation for its fall—it w as pushed, 
it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.
An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm’s 
reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A 
phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the 
target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a 
pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on 
your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage 
to the target if it is in the phantasm’s area or within 5 
feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a 
creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, 
such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage 
as a type appropriate to the illusion.

4th-level illusion

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see 
within range and create an illusory manifestation of its 
deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target 
must make a W isdom  saving throw. On a failed save, 
the target becom es frightened for the duration. At the 
start of each o f the target’s turns before the spell ends, 
the target must succeed on a W isdom  saving throw 
or take 4 d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, 
the spell ends.

A Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on 
the ground in an unoccupied space o f your choice 
within range. You decide the creature’s appearance, 
but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any 
of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a 
puff of sm oke if it is carried m ore than 10 feet away 
from the steed.
For the duration, you or a creature you choose can 
ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a 
riding horse, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can 
travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 m iles at a fast pace. 
W hen the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving 
the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use 
an action to dism iss it or if the steed takes any damage.

6th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 10 minutes 
Range: 60 feet 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Instantaneous
You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being 
must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a demon 
prince, or som e other being of cosm ic power. That entity 
sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to 
aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied 
space within range. If you know a specific creature’s 
name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell 
to request that creature, though you might get a different 
creature anyway (DM ’s choice).
W hen the creature appears, it is under no com pulsion 
to behave in any particular way. You can ask the 
creature to perform  a service in exchange for payment, 
but it isn’t obliged to do so. The requested task could 
range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us 
fight a battle) to com plex (spy on our enemies, or protect
us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be 
able to com m unicate with the creature to bargain for 
its services.
Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might 
require a sizable donation of gold or m agic items to 
an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living 
sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Som e creatures might 
exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.
As a rule of thumb, a task that can be m easured in 
minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A 
task m easured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And 
a task m easured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 
gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on 
the circum stances under which you cast the spell. If the 
task is aligned with the creature’s ethos, the payment 
might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks 
typically require only half the suggested payment, while 
especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. 
Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem  suicidal.
After the creature com pletes the task, or when the 
agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature 
returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, 
if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are 
unable to agree on a price for the creature’s service, the 
creature immediately returns to its hom e plane.
A creature enlisted to join your group counts as 
a m em ber of it, receiving a full share of experience 
points awarded.

Duration: 24 hours
With this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an 
elemental, a fey, or a fiend to your service. The creature 
must be within range for the entire casting of the spell. 
(Typically, the creature is first sum m oned into the center 
of an inverted magic circle in order to keep it trapped 
while this spell is cast.) At the com pletion of the casting, 
the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a 
failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If 
the creature w as sum m oned or created by another spell, 
that spell’s duration is extended to match the duration 
of this spell.
A bound creature must follow your instructions to the 
best of its ability. You might com m and the creature to 
accom pany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or 
to deliver a m essage. The creature obeys the letter of 
your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it 
strives to twist your w ords to achieve its own objectives. 
If the creature carries out your instructions completely 
before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact 
if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a 
different plane of existence, it returns to the place where 
you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.
At Higher Levels. W hen you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of a higher level, the duration increases to 10 
days with a 6th-level slot, to 30 days with a 7th-level slot, 
to 180 days with an 8th-level slot, and to a year and a 
day with a 9th-level spell slot.

You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in 
a circle are transported to a different plane of existence. 
You can specify a target destination in general terms, 
such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of 
Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the 
Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination.
If you are trying to reach the City o f Brass, for example, 
you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of 
Ashes, or looking at the city from  across the Sea of Fire, 
at the DM ’s discretion.
Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a 
teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this 
spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation 
circle is too small to hold all the creatures you 
transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied 
spaces next to the circle.
You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature 
to another plane. C hoose a creature within your reach 
and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the 
creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the 
creature fails this save, it is transported to a random 
location on the plane of existence you specify. A creature 
so transported must find its own way back to your 
current plane of existence.

This spell transforms a creature that you can see 
within range into a new form. An unwilling creature 
must make a W isdom  saving throw to avoid the 
effect. A shapechanger automatically succeeds on this 
saving throw.
The transformation lasts for the duration, or until 
the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form 
can be any beast w hose challenge rating is equal to or 
less than the target’s (or the target’s level, if it doesn't 
have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, 
including mental ability scores, are replaced by the 
statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment 
and personality.
The target assum es the hit points of its new form. 
W hen it reverts to its normal form, the creature 
returns to the number of hit points it had before it 
transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to
0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its 
normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t 
reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t 
knocked unconscious.
The creature is limited in the actions it can perform  by 
the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, 
or take any other action that requires hands or speech.
The target’s gear melds into the new form. The 
creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit 
from any of its equipment.

Eight multicolored rays of light flash from  your hand. 
Each ray is a different color and has a different power 
and purpose. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must 
make a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a d8 
to determine which color ray affects it.
1. Red. The target takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed 
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
2. Orange. The target takes 10d6 acid damage on a 
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
3. Yellow. The target takes 10d6 lightning damage on a 
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
4. Green. The target takes 10d6 poison damage on a 
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
5. Blue. The target takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed 
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
6. Indigo. On a failed save, the target is restrained.
It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the 
end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three 
times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times,
it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the 
petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t 
need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the 
target collects three of a kind.
7. Violet. On a failed save, the target is blinded. It 
must then make a W isdom  saving throw at the start of 
your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If 
it fails that save, the creature is transported to another 
plane of existence of the DM ’s choosing and is no longer 
blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t 
its hom e plane is banished home, while other creatures 
are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)
8. Special. The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice 
more, rerolling any 8.

A shimmering, m ulticolored plane of light form s a 
vertical opaque wall—up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, 
and 1 inch thick—centered on a point you can see 
within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into 
a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point 
you choose within range. The wall remains in place for 
the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes 
through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, 
and your action and the spell slot are wasted.
The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 
feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and 
creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell 
can pass through and remain near the wall without 
harm. If another creature that can see the wall m oves to 
within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature
must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or becom e 
blinded for 1 minute.
The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different 
color. W hen a creature attempts to reach into or pass 
through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through 
all the wall’s layers. As it passes or reaches through 
each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving 
throw or be affected by that layer’s properties as 
described below.
The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in 
order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. 
Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration 
of the spell. A rod of 
cancellation destroys a prismatic 
wall, but an antimagic field has no effect on it.
1. Red. The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a 
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
W hile this layer is in place, nonm agical ranged attacks 
can’t pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed 
by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.
2. Orange. The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on 
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful 
one. W hile this layer is in place, m agical ranged attacks 
can’t pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by

3. Yellow. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage 
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful 
one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 
force damage to it.
4. Green. The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on 
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful 
one. A passwall spell, or another spell of equal or 
greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, 
destroys this layer.
5. Blue. The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a 
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire 
damage to it.
6. Indigo. On a failed save, the creature is restrained. 
It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the 
end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three 
times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times,
it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the 
petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t 
need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the 
creature collects three of a kind.
W hile this layer is in place, spells can’t be cast 
through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light 
shed by a daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or 
higher level.
7. Violet. On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It 
must then make a W isdom  saving throw at the start of 
your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If 
it fails that save, the creature is transported to another 
plane of the DM ’s choosing and is no longer blinded. 
(Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its 
hom e plane is banished home, while other creatures 
are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This 
layer is destroyed by a dispel magic spell or a similar 
spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and 
m agical effects.

A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame 
remains there for the duration and harms neither you 
nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 
10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. 
The spell ends if you dism iss it as an action or if you 
cast it again.
You can also attack with the flame, although doing so 
ends the spell. W hen you cast this spell, or as an action 
on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature 
within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a 
hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.
This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach

6th-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece and jade dust worth 
at least 25 gp)
Duration: Until dispelled
You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or 
som e other visible phenom enon within range that 
activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion 
is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 
30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell 
how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This 
scripted perform ance can last up to 5 minutes.
W hen the condition you specify occurs, the illusion 
springs into existence and perform s in the manner you 
described. Once the illusion finishes perform ing, it 
disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After 
this time, the illusion can be activated again.
The triggering condition can be as general or as 
detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or 
audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. 
For example, you could create an illusion of yourself 
to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a 
trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only 
when a creature says the correct w ord or phrase.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an 
illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature 
that uses its action to examine the image can determine 
that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence 
(Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a 
creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature 
can see through the image, and any noise it makes 
sounds hollow to the creature.

Components: V, S, M (a small replica o f you made from

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 day
You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for 
the duration. The copy can appear at any location 
within range that you have seen before, regardless of 
intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds 
like you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any 
damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.
You can use your action to move this illusion up to 
twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and 
behave in whatever way you choose. It m im ics your 
m annerism s perfectly.
You can see through its eyes and hear through its 
ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus 
action, you can switch from using its senses to using 
your own, or back again. W hile you are using its senses, 
you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own 
surroundings.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an

The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of

You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided 
that it has been dead no longer than 10 days. If the 
creature’s soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the 
body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.
This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures 
nonm agical diseases that affected the creature at the 
time it died. This spell doesn’t, however, remove magical 
diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren’t first 
removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when 
the creature returns to life. The spell can’t return an 
undead creature to life.
This spell closes all mortal w ounds, but it doesn’t 
restore m issing body parts. If the creature is lacking 
body parts or organs integral for its survival—its head, 
for instance—the spell automatically fails.
Com ing back from the dead is an ordeal. The target 
takes a - 4  penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and 
ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, 
the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.

You touch a dead humanoid or a piece o f a dead

You touch a dead creature that has been dead for no

This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal

however, remove magical diseases, curses, and the like; 
if such effects aren't removed prior to casting the spell,

If som e solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered

5th-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 30 feet 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 8 hours
This spell allows you to change the appearance of any 
number of creatures that you can see within range. You 
give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. 
An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, 
and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.
The spell disguises physical appearance as well as 
clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make 
each creature seem  1 foot shorter or taller and appear 
thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change a target’s body 
type, so you must choose a form that has the same 
basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of 
the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, 
unless you use your action to dism iss it sooner.
The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to 
physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell 
to add a hat to a creature’s outfit, objects pass through 
the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing 
or w ould feel the creature’s head and hair. If you use 
this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of
som eone w ho reaches out to touch you would bump into 
you while it was seem ingly still in midair.
A creature can use its action to inspect a target and 
make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your 
spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becom es aware that the 
target is disguised.

with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the

it becom es invisible and can’t be targeted by divination

The condition can be anything you choose, but it

You assume the form of a different creature for the 
duration. The new form can be of any creature with 
a challenge rating equal to your level or lower. The
creature can’t be a construct or an undead, and you 
must have seen the sort of creature at least once. You 
transform into an average example o f that creature, one 
without any class levels or the Spellcasting trait.
Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics 
of the chosen creature, though you retain your 
alignment and Intelligence, W isdom , and Charisma 
scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving 
throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the 
creature. If the creature has the sam e proficiency as you 
and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, 
use the creature’s bonus in place of yours. You can’t use 
any legendary actions or lair actions of the new form.
You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new 
form. When you revert to your normal form, you 
return to the number o f hit points you had before you 
transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to
0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your 
normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t 
reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t 
knocked unconscious.
You retain the benefit o f any features from your class, 
race, or other source and can use them, provided that 
your new form is physically capable of doing so. You 
can’t use any special senses you have (for example, 
darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. 
You can only speak if the creature can normally speak.
W hen you transform, you choose whether your 
equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new 
form, or is worn by it. W orn equipment functions as 
normal. The DM determines whether it is practical for 
the new form to w ear a piece of equipment, based on 
the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t 
change shape or size to match the new form, and any 
equipment that the new form can’t w ear must either fall 
to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment 
that merges has no effect in that state.
During this spell’s duration, you can use your action to 
assume a different form following the same restrictions 
and rules for the original form, with one exception: if 
your new form has more hit points than your current 
one, your hit points remain at their current value.

1st-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create the image of an object, a creature, or som e 
other visible phenom enon that is no larger than a 15-foot 
cube. The image appears at a spot within range and 
lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn't 
accom panied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.
You can use your action to cause the image to move to 
any spot within range. As the im age changes location, 
you can alter its appearance so that its movements 
appear natural for the image. For example, if you create 
an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the 
image so that it appears to be walking.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an 
illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature 
that uses its action to examine the image can determine 
that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence 
(Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a 
creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature 
can see through the image.

7th-level illusion
Casting Time: 12 hours 
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (snow or ice in quantities 
sufficient to made a life-size copy of the duplicated 
creature; som e hair, fingernail clippings, or other 
piece o f that creature’s body placed inside the snow 
or ice; and powdered ruby worth 1,500 gp, sprinkled 
over the duplicate and consum ed by the spell) 
Duration: Until dispelled
You shape an illusory duplicate of one beast or 
humanoid that is within range for the entire casting 
time of the spell. The duplicate is a creature, partially 
real and form ed from ice or snow, and it can take 
actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature.
It appears to be the same as the original, but it has half 
the creature’s hit point maximum and is form ed without 
any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion uses all the 
statistics of the creature it duplicates.
The simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you 
designate. It obeys your spoken com m ands, moving 
and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting 
on your turn in combat. The simulacrum lacks the 
ability to learn or becom e m ore powerful, so it never 
increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain 
expended spell slots.
If the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an 
alchemical laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals 
worth 100 gp per hit point it regains. The simulacrum 
lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it 
reverts to snow  and melts instantly.
If you cast this spell again, any currently 
active duplicates you created with this spell are 
instantly destroyed.

unconscious creatures).
Starting with the creature that has the lowest current 
hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls 
unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes 
damage, or som eone uses an action to shake or slap the 
sleeper awake. Subtract each creature’s hit points from  
the total before moving on to the creature with the next 
lowest hit points. A creature’s hit points must be equal 
to or less than the remaining total for that creature 
to be affected.

20-foot-tall cylinder with a 40-foot radius centered on 
a point you choose within range. The area is heavily 
obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused.
The ground in the area is covered with slick ice, 
making it difficult terrain. W hen a creature enters the

You alter time around up to six creatures o f your 
choice in a 40-foot cube within range. Each target must 
succeed on a W isdom  saving throw or be affected by 
this spell for the duration.
An affected target’s speed is halved, it takes a -2  
penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can’t 
use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or 
a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature’s 
abilities or magic items, it can’t make m ore than one 
melee or ranged attack during its turn.
If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting 
time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell 
doesn’t take effect until the creature’s next turn, and the 
creature must use its action on that turn to complete the 
spell. If it can’t, the spell is wasted.
A creature affected by this spell makes another 
W isdom  saving throw at the end of its turn. On a 
successful save, the effect ends for it.

3rd-level necromancy

Duration: 10 minutes
You grant the sem blance of life and intelligence to a 
corpse of your choice within range, allowing it to answer 
the questions you pose. The corpse must still have a
mouth and can’t be undead. The spell fails if the corpse 
was the target of this spell within the last 10 days.
Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five 
questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, 
including the languages it knew. Answers are usually 
brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no 
com pulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile 
to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn’t 
return the creature’s soul to its body, only its animating 
spirit. Thus, the corpse can’t learn new information, 
doesn’t comprehend anything that has happened since it 
died, and can’t speculate about future events.

about creatures that have passed, weather, and other 
circum stances.
You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant 
growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary 
terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn 
ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult 
terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and 
branches to hinder pursuers, for example.
Plants might be able to perform  other tasks on your 
behalf, at the DM ’s discretion. The spell doesn’t enable 
plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they 
can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.
If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate 
with it as if you shared a com m on language, but you 
gain no magical ability to influence it.
This spell can cause the plants created by the entangle 
spell to release a restrained creature.

powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at 
least 1,000 gp, which the spell consum es)
Duration: Until dispelled or triggered
W hen you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph 
either on a surface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or 
a table) or within an object that can be closed to conceal 
the glyph (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest).
If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of 
the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you 
choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if 
the object is moved m ore than 10 feet from where you 
cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends 
without being triggered.
The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence 
(Investigation) check against your spell save 
DC to find it.
You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the 
spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical 
triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, 
removing another object covering it, approaching within 
a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object 
that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, 
the most com m on triggers are opening the object, 
approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or 
reading the glyph.
You can further refine the trigger so the spell is 
activated only under certain circum stances or according 
to a creature’s physical characteristics (such as height 
or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could 
be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also 
specify creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as 
those who say a certain password.
W hen you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the 
options below  for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph 
glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light 
for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each 
creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is 
targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the 
sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.
Death. Each target must make a Constitution saving 
throw, taking 10d 10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or 
half as much damage on a successful save.
Discord. Each target must make a Constitution saving 
throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and argues 
with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time,
it is incapable o f meaningful com m unication and has 
disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
Fear. Each target must make a W isdom  saving throw 
and becom es frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. 
W hile frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding 
and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on 
each of its turns, if able.
H opelessness. Each target must make a Charisma 
saving throw. On a failed save, the target is 
overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this 
time, it can’t attack or target any creature with harmful 
abilities, spells, or other magical effects.
Insanity. Each target must make an Intelligence saving 
throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for
1 minute. An insane creature can’t take actions, can't 
understand what other creatures say, can’t read, and 
speaks only in gibberish. The DM controls its movement, 
which is erratic.
Pain. Each target must make a Constitution saving 
throw and becom es incapacitated with excruciating pain 
for 1 minute on a failed save.
Sleep. Each target must make a W isdom  saving throw 
and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A 
creature awakens if it takes damage or if som eone uses

waved in the air)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
A creature of your choice that you can see within range 
perceives everything as hilariously funny and falls 
into fits of laughter if this spell affects it. The target 
must succeed on a W isdom  saving throw or fall prone, 
becom ing incapacitated and unable to stand up for the 
duration. A creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or 
less isn’t affected.

Casting Time: 1
 action 
Range: 60 feet 
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures 
or objects by thought. W hen you cast the spell, and as 
your action each round for the duration, you can exert 
your will on one creature or object that you can see 
within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You 
can affect the same target round after round, or choose 
a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior 
target is no longer affected by the spell.
Creature. You can try to move a Huge or smaller 
creature. Make an ability check with your spellcasting 
ability contested by the creature’s Strength check. If 
you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet 
in any direction, including upward but not beyond the 
range of this spell. Until the end of your next turn, the 
creature is restrained in your telekinetic grip. A creature 
lifted upward is suspended in mid-air.
On subsequent rounds, you can use your action to 
attempt to maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature 
by repeating the contest.
Object. You can try to move an object that weighs 
up to 1,000 pounds. If the object isn’t being worn or 
carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any 
direction, but not beyond the range of this spell.
If the object is w orn or carried by a creature, you must 
make an ability check with your spellcasting ability 
contested by that creature’s Strength check. If you 
succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and 
can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond 
the range of this spell.
You can exert fine control on objects with your 
telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, 
opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving 
an item from an open container, or pouring the 
contents from a vial.

Familiarity. “Permanent circle” means a permanent 
teleportation circle w hose sigil sequence you know. 
“Associated object” means that you possess an object 
taken from the desired destination within the last six 
months, such as a book from a wizard’s library, bed 
linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a 
lich’s secret tomb.
“Very familiar” is a place you have been very often, a 
place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see 
when you cast the spell. “Seen casually” is som eplace 
you have seen m ore than once but with which you aren’t 
very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place you have seen 
once, possibly using magic. “Description” is a place 
w hose location and appearance you know through 
som eone else’s description, perhaps from a map.
“False destination” is a place that doesn’t exist. 
Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but 
instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to 
teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.
On Target. You and your group (or the target object) 
appear where you want to.
O ff 
Target. You and your group (or the target object) 
appear a random distance away from  the destination 
in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 x 
1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled.
For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off 
target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d 10s, then you 
would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM 
determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a 
d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, 
and so on around the points of the com pass. If you were 
teleporting to a coastal city and w ound up 18 m iles out 
at sea, you could be in trouble.
Similar 
Area. You and your group (or the target 
object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or 
thematically similar to the target area. If you are 
heading for your hom e laboratory, for example, you 
might wind up in another w izard’s laboratory or in 
an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same 
tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, 
you appear in the closest similar place, but since the 
spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up 
anywhere on the plane.
Mishap. The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a 
difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target 
object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on
the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps 
can occur, dealing damage each time).

5th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 minute 
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, M (rare chalks and inks infused with 
precious gems with 50 gp, which the spell consum es) 
Duration: 1 round
As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter 
circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link 
your location to a permanent teleportation circle of 
your choice w hose sigil sequence you know and that is 
on the sam e plane of existence as you. A shimmering 
portal opens within the circle you drew and remains 
open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that 
enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the 
destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if 
that space is occupied.
Many major temples, guilds, and other important 
places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed 
som ewhere within their confines. Each such circle 
includes a unique sigil sequence—a string of magical 
runes arranged in a particular pattern. W hen you first 
gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil 
sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, 
determined by the DM. You can learn additional sigil 
sequences during your adventures. You can commit 
a new sigil sequence to m em ory after studying it 
for 1 minute.
You can create a permanent teleportation circle by 
casting this spell in the same location every day for one 
year. You need not use the circle to teleport when you 
cast the spell in this way.

1st-level conjuration (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a drop of mercury)
Duration: 1 hour
This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force,
3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet 
above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice 
that you can see within range. The disk remains for the 
duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If m ore weight 
is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk 
falls to the ground.
The disk is im m obile while you are within 20 feet of 
it. If you move m ore than 20 feet away from it, the disk 
follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It 
can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, 
slopes and the like, but it can’t cross an elevation change 
of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can’t move 
across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it 
was created at the bottom.
If you move m ore than 100 feet from the disk (typically 
because it can’t move around an obstacle to follow you), 
the spell ends.

C hoose one creature or nonm agical object that you 
can see within range. You transform the creature into 
a different creature, the creature into an object, or the 
object into a creature (the object must be neither worn 
nor carried by another creature). The transformation 
lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit 
points or dies. If you concentrate on this spell for the full 
duration, the transformation becom es permanent.
Shapechangers aren’t affected by this spell. An 
unwilling creature can make a W isdom  saving throw, 
and if it succeeds, it isn’t affected by this spell.
Creature into Creature. If you turn a creature into 
another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind 
you choose w hose challenge rating is equal to or less 
than the target’s (or its level, if the target doesn’t have a 
challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including 
mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of 
the new form. It retains its alignment and personality.
The target assum es the hit points of its new form, 
and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature 
returns to the number of hit points it had before it 
transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to
0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its 
normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t 
reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t 
knocked unconscious.
The creature is limited in the actions it can perform  by 
the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, 
or take any other action that requires hands or speech 
unless its new form is capable of such actions.
The target’s gear melds into the new form. The 
creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit 
from any of its equipment.
Object into Creature. You can turn an object into 
any kind of creature, as long as the creature’s size 
is no larger than the object’s size and the creature’s 
challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to 
you and your com panions. It acts on each of your turns. 
You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The 
DM has the creature’s statistics and resolves all of its 
actions and movement.
If the spell becom es permanent, you no longer control 
the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending 
on how  you have treated it.
Creature into Object. If you turn a creature into an 
object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing 
and carrying into that form. The creature’s statistics 
becom e those of the object, and the creature has no 
m em ory o f time spent in this form, after the spell ends 
and it returns to its normal form.

A creature caught in the wall can move by swimming. 
Because of the force of the wave, though, the creature

occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid 
air for the first time on a turn must make a Constitution 
saving throw. That creature takes 5d6 cold damage on a 
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
A t Higher Levels. W hen you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage the wall 
deals when it appears increases by 2d6, and the damage 
from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by 
1d6, for each slot level above 6th.

5th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1
 action 
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a small block of granite) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
A nonm agical wall of solid stone springs into existence 
at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches 
thick and is com posed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. 
Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other 
panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot 
panels that are only 3 inches thick.
If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it 
appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall 
(your choice). If a creature w ould be surrounded on all 
sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), 
that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a 
success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so 
that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.
The wall can have any shape you desire, though it 
can’t occupy the same space as a creature or object.
The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or rest on any firm 
foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly 
supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell 
to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.
If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you 
must halve the size of each panel to create supports.
You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, 
battlements, and so on.
The wall is an object made of stone that can be 
damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 
30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel 
to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected 
panels to collapse at the DM ’s discretion.
If you maintain your concentration on this spell for 
its whole duration, the wall becom es permanent and 
can’t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when 
the spell ends.

6th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a handful of thorns)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush 
bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears 
within range on a solid surface and lasts for the 
duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet 
long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has 
a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet 
thick. The wall blocks line of sight.
W hen the wall appears, each creature within its area 
must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, 
a creature takes 7d8 piercing damage, or half as much 
damage on a successful save.
A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly 
and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature m oves 
through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. 
Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall 
on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must
make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d8 slashing 
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a 
successful one.
At Higher Levels. W hen you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 7th level or higher, both types of damage 
increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.

Components: V, S, M (a pair of platinum rings worth at 
least 50 gp each, which you and the target must wear 
for the duration)
Duration: 1
 hour
This spell wards a willing creature you touch and 
creates a mystic connection between you and the target 
until the spell ends. W hile the target is within 60 feet of 
you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and 
it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes 
damage, you take the sam e amount of damage.
The spell ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you 
and the target becom e separated by m ore than 60 feet. 
It also ends if the spell is cast again on either o f the 
connected creatures. You can also dismiss the spell 
as an action.

Duration: 1

This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid 
surface—such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, 
or lava—as if it were harm less solid ground (creatures 
crossing molten lava can still take damage from the 
heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can see within 
range gain this ability for the duration.
If you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the 
spell carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a 
rate of 60 feet per round.
W eb
2nd-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit o f spiderweb)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You conjure a m ass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of 
your choice within range. The w ebs fill a 20-foot cube 
from  that point for the duration. The w ebs are difficult 
terrain and lightly obscure their area.
If the w ebs aren’t anchored between two solid m asses 
(such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, 
or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the 
spell ends at the start of your next turn. W ebs layered 
over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.
Each creature that starts its turn in the w ebs or that 
enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity 
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained 
as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.
A creature restrained by the w ebs can use its action to 
make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it 
succeeds, it is no longer restrained.
The w ebs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs 
exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire 
damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.

9th-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 120 feet 
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to one minute
Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, 
you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible 
only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius 
sphere centered on a point of your choice within 
range must make a W isdom  saving throw. On a failed 
save, a creature becom es frightened for the duration. 
The illusion calls on the creature’s deepest fears, 
manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable 
threat. At the start of each of the frightened creature’s 
turns, it must succeed on a W isdom  saving throw or 
take 4 d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the 
spell ends for that creature.

6th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 minute 
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (fire and holy water)
Duration: 8 hours
You and up to ten willing creatures you can see 
within range assume a gaseous form for the duration, 
appearing as w isps o f cloud. W hile in this cloud form, 
a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has 
resistance to damage from  nonm agical weapons. The 
only actions a creature can take in this form are the 
Dash action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting 
takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is 
incapacitated and can’t move. Until the spell ends, a 
creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires 
the 1-minute transformation.
If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect 
ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 
minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can’t land 
after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.

3rd-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a tiny fan and a feather of 
exotic origin)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
A  wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point 
you choose within range. You can make the wall up 
to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can 
shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it 
makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall 
lasts for the duration.
W hen the wall appears, each creature within its area 
must make a Strength saving throw. A creature takes 
3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as 
much damage on a successful one.
The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at 
bay. Sm all or smaller flying creatures or objects can’t 
pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials 
brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and 
other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind 
the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss. 
(Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar 
projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form 
can’t pass through it.

9th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Self 
Components: V 
Duration: Instantaneous
Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can 
cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very 
foundations of reality in accord with your desires.
The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other 
spell of 8th level or lower. You don’t need to meet any 
requirements in that spell, including costly components. 
The spell simply takes effect.
Alternatively, you can create one of the following 
effects of your choice:
•
 You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that 
isn’t a m agic item. The object can be no m ore than
300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoc­
cupied space you can see on the ground.
•
 You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to 
regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them 
described in the greater restoration spell.
•
 You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resis­
tance to a damage type you choose.
•
 You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to 
a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For 
instance, you could make yourself and all your com ­
panions immune to a lich’s life drain attack.
•
 You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of 
any roll made within the last round (including your 
last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accom m odate the 
new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an 
opponent’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a 
friend’s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made 
with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose 
whether to use the reroll or the original roll.
You might be able to achieve som ething beyond the 
scope o f the above examples. State your wish to the DM 
as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in 
ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the 
wish, the greater the likelihood that som ething goes 
wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire 
might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer som e 
unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded 
the wish. For example, wishing that a villain w ere dead 
might propel you forward in time to a period when that 
villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from 
the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item 
or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence 
of the item’s current owner.
The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect 
other than duplicating another spell w eakens you. After 
enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until 
you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage 
per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or 
prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops 
to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each 
of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing 
m ore than light activity, your remaining recovery time 
decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent 
chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you 
suffer this stress.

1st-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a twig from a tree that has been 
struck by lightning)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
A beam  of crackling, blue energy lances out toward 
a creature within range, form ing a sustained arc of 
lightning between you and the target. Make a ranged 
spell attack against that creature. On a hit, the target 
takes 1d12 lightning damage, and on each of your turns 
for the duration, you can use your action to deal 1d12 
lightning damage to the target automatically. The spell 
ends if you use your action to do anything else. The spell
also ends if the target is ever outside the spell’s range or 
if it has total cover from you.
At Higher Levels. W hen you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial damage 
increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 1st.

You and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you 
instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary. 
You and any creatures that teleport with you appear in 
the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you designated 
when you prepared your sanctuary (see below). If you 
cast this spell without first preparing a sanctuary, the 
spell has no effect.
You must designate a sanctuary by casting this spell 
within a location, such as a temple, dedicated to or 
strongly linked to your deity. If you attempt to cast the 
spell in this manner in an area that isn’t dedicated to 
your deity, the spell has no effect.

The next time you hit with a melee w eapon attack 
during this spell’s duration, your attack deals an extra 
1d6 psychic damage. Additionally, if the target is a 
creature, it must make a W isdom  saving throw or be 
frightened of you until the spell ends. As an action, the 
creature can make a W isdom  check against your spell 
save DC to steel its resolve and end this spell.

2nd-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 10 minutes
You create a m agical zone that guards against deception 
in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point o f your 
choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature 
that enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn 
or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving 
throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a 
deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether 
each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.
An affected creature is aware o f the spell and can thus 
avoid answering questions to which it would normally 
respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in 
its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries 
of the truth.

ONDITIONS ALTER A CREATURE’S CAPABILITIES IN
a variety of ways and can arise as a result of 
a spell, a class feature, a monster’s attack, 
or other effect. Most conditions, such as 
blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as 
invisible, can be advantageous.
A condition lasts either until it is countered 
(the prone condition is countered by standing 
up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect 
that im posed the condition.
If multiple effects im pose the same condition on a 
creature, each instance of the condition has its own 
duration, but the condition’s effects don't get worse.
A creature either has a condition or doesn’t.
The follow ing definitions specify what happens to 
a creature w hile it is subjected to a condition.

E x h a u s t io n
Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as 
starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching 
temperatures, can lead to a special condition called 
exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect 
can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as 
specified in the effect’s description.
Level
Effect
1
Disadvantage on ability checks
2
Speed halved
3
Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws
4
Hit point maximum halved
5
Speed reduced to 0
6
Death
If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that 
causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases 
by the amount specified in the effect’s description.
A creature suffers the effect of its current level of 
exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature 
suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has 
disadvantage on ability checks.
An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as 
specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion 
effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced 
below 1.
Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level 
by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some 
food and drink.

ELIGION IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF LIFE IN
t h e worlds of the D&D multiverse. When 
gods walk the world, clerics channel divine 
power, evil cults perform  dark sacrifices in 
subterranean lairs, and shining paladins 
stand like beacons against the darkness, it’s 
hard to be ambivalent about the deities and 
deny their existence.
Many people in the worlds of D&D worship different 
gods at different times and circum stances. People in 
the Forgotten Realms, for example, might pray to Sune 
for luck in love, make an offering to W aukeen before 
heading to the market, and pray to appease Talos when 
a severe storm blows in—all in the sam e day. Many 
people have a favorite am ong the gods, one w hose ideals 
and teachings they make their own. And a few people 
dedicate themselves entirely to a single god, usually 
serving as a priest or champion of that god’s ideals.
Your DM determines which gods, if any, are worshiped 
in his or her campaign. From among the gods available, 
you can choose a single deity for your character to 
serve, worship, or pay lip service to. Or you can pick 
a few that your character prays to most often. Or just 
make a mental note of the gods w ho are revered in your 
DM ’s campaign so you can invoke their names when 
appropriate. If you’re playing a cleric or a character with 
the Acolyte background, decide which god your deity 
serves or served, and consider the deity’s suggested 
dom ains when selecting your character’s domain.
D&D P a n t h e o n s
Each world in the D&D multiverse has its own 
pantheons of deities, ranging in size from the teeming 
pantheons of the Forgotten Realm s and Greyhawk to 
the m ore focused religions of Eberron and Dragonlance. 
Many of the nonhuman races worship the sam e gods on 
different w orlds—Moradin, for example, is revered by 
dwarves of the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, and many 
other worlds.
T h e  F o r g o t t e n  R e a l m s
D ozens of deities are revered, worshiped, and feared 
throughout the world of the Forgotten Realms. At least 
thirty deities are widely known across the Realms, and 
many m ore are worshiped locally, by individual tribes, 
small cults, or certain sects of larger religious temples.
T h e  L ife a n d  D e a t h  D o m a i n s
Many deities in this section suggest the Life domain, 
particularly if they are closely associated with healing, 
protection, childbirth, nurturing, or fertility. As described in
 
the chapter 3, though, the Life domain is incredibly broad, 
and a cleric of any non-evil deity can choose it.
A number of other deities, mostly evil ones, suggest the 
Death domain, which is detailed in the Dungeon Master’s 
Guide. Most clerics who choose this domain are evil NPCs, 
but if you want to worship a god of death, consult your 
Dungeon Master.
G r e y h a w k
The gods o f Greyhawk com e from at least four different 
pantheons, representing the faiths of the various ethnic 
groups that populated the continent of Oerik over the 
ages. As a result, there’s a great deal of overlap in their 
portfolios: Pelor is the Flan god of the sun and Pholtus 
is the Oeridian sun god, for example.
D r a g o n l a n c e
The gods of the world of Krynn are three families: seven 
gods of good headed by Paladine and Mishakal, seven of 
neutrality headed by Gilean, and seven of evil headed by 
Takhisis and Sargonnas. These deities have been called 
by many different names and held in varying levels of 
esteem by different peoples and cultures through the 
w orld’s history, but they are the only gods of this w orld— 
their place fixed in the stars as constellations.
E b e r r o n
The world of Eberron has many different religions, but 
the most important revolves around a pantheon called 
the Sovereign Host and their malign shadow, the Dark 
Six. The gods of the Sovereign Host are thought to have 
dom inion over every aspect of existence, and to speak 
with a unified voice. But the Dark Six are the primitive, 
bloody, and cruel gods w ho offer a dissenting voice.
Eberron’s other religions are very different from the 
traditional D&D pantheons. The monotheistic Church 
of the Silver Flame is devoted to fighting against evil in 
the world, but plagued by corruption in its own ranks. 
The philosophy of the Blood of Vol teaches that divinity 
lies within all mortal beings and reveres the undead 
who have secured that immortality. Various mad cults 
are devoted to the dem ons and horrors imprisoned 
in Eberron's Underdark (called Khyber, the Dragon 
Below). The followers of the Path of Light believe that 
the w orld is heading toward a glorious future where 
the shadows that cloud this world will be transformed 
into light. And two related nations of elves revere their 
ancestral spirits: the Undying Court, preserved as 
spirits or even undead forms, and the glorified Spirits 
of the Past, the great heroes of ancient wars.
N o n h u m a n  D e i t ie s
Certain gods closely associated with nonhuman races 
are revered on many different worlds, though not always 
in the same way. The nonhuman races of the Forgotten 
Realm s and Greyhawk share these deities.
Nonhuman races often have whole pantheons of 
their own. Besides Moradin, for example, the dwarf 
gods include M oradin’s wife, Berronar Truesilver, and 
a number of other gods thought to be their children 
and grandchildren: Abbathor, Clangeddin Silverbeard, 
Dugmaren Brightmantle, Dumathoin, Gorm  Gulthyn, 
Haela Brightaxe, M arthammor Duin, Sharindlar, Thard 
Harr, and Vergadain. Individual clans and kingdom s of 
dwarves might revere som e, all, or none of these deities, 
and som e have other gods unknown (or known by other 
names) to outsiders.

The Celtic, Egyptian, Greek, and Norse pantheons are 
fantasy interpretations of historical religions from our 
w orld’s ancient times. They include deities that are 
most appropriate for use in a D&D game, divorced from 
their historical context in the real world and united into 
pantheons that serve the needs of the game.
T h e  C e l t ic  Pa n t h e o n
It’s said that som ething wild lurks in the heart of every 
soul, a space that thrills to the sound of geese calling 
at night, to the whispering wind through the pines, to 
the unexpected red of mistletoe on an oak—and it is in 
this space that the Celtic gods dwell. They sprang from 
the brook and stream, their might heightened by the 
strength of the oak and the beauty of the woodlands and 
open moor. W hen the first forester dared put a name to 
the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling 
in a brook, these gods forced themselves into being.
The Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by 
clerics, for they are closely aligned with the forces of 
nature that druids revere.
T h e  G r e e k  Pa n t h e o n
The gods of Olympus make themselves known with the 
gentle lap of waves against the shores and the crash of 
the thunder am ong the cloud-enshrouded peaks. The 
thick boar-infested w oods and the sere, olive-covered 
hillsides hold evidence of their passing. Every aspect 
of nature echoes with their presence, and they’ve made 
a place for themselves inside the human heart, too.
T h e  E g y p t i a n  Pa n t h e o n
These gods are a young dynasty of an ancient divine 
family, heirs to the rulership of the cosm os and the 
maintenance of the divine principle of Ma’at—the 
fundamental order of truth, justice, law, and order that 
puts gods, mortal pharaohs, and ordinary men and 
w om en in their logical and rightful place in the universe.
The Egyptian pantheon is unusual in having three 
gods with the Death dom ain o f different alignments. 
Anubis is the lawful neutral god of the afterlife, who
Fa n t a s y - H is t o r ic a l  Pa n t h e o n s
judges the souls of the dead. Set is a chaotic evil god 
of murder, perhaps best known for killing his brother 
Osiris. And Nephthys is a chaotic good goddess of 
mourning. Thus, although m ost clerics of the Death 
domain (found in the Dungeon Master's Guide) are 
villainous characters, clerics w ho serve Anubis or 
Nephthys need not be.
T h e  N o r s e  Pa n t h e o n
W here the land plummets from the snowy hills into the 
icy fjords below, where the longboats draw up on to the 
beach, where the glaciers flow forward and retreat with 
every fall and spring—this is the land of the Vikings, 
the hom e of the Norse pantheon. It’s a brutal clime, 
and one that calls for brutal living. The w arriors of 
the land have had to adapt to the harsh conditions in 
order to survive, but they haven’t been too twisted by
the needs of their environment. Given the necessity of 
raiding for food and wealth, it’s surprising the mortals 
turned out as well as they did. Their powers reflect 
the need these warriors had for strong leadership and 
decisive action. Thus, they see their deities in every 
bend of a river, hear them in the crash of the thunder 
and the boom ing of the glaciers, and smell them in the 
sm oke of a burning longhouse.
The Norse pantheon includes two main families, the 
Aesir (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir (gods 
of fertility and prosperity). Once enemies, these two 
families are now closely allied against their com m on 
enemies, the giants (including the gods Surtur and 
Thrym). Like the gods of Greyhawk, gods in different 
families som etim es have overlap in their spheres of 
influence: Frey (of the Vanir) and Odur (of the Aesir) 
are both associated with the sun, for example.

NCREDIBLY VAST IS THE COSMOS OF THE
D u n g e o n s  &  D r a g o n s  game, which teems 
with a multitude o f worlds as well as myriad 
alternate dim ensions of reality, called the planes 
of existence. It encom passes every world 
where Dungeon Masters run their adventures, 
all within the relatively mundane realm of the 
Material Plane. Beyond that plane are domains 
of raw elemental matter and energy, realm s of pure 
thought and ethos, the hom es of dem ons and angels, 
and the dom inions of the gods.
Many spells and magic items can draw energy 
from these planes, sum m on the creatures that dwell 
there, com m unicate with their denizens, and allow 
adventurers to travel there. As your character achieves 
greater power and higher levels, you might undertake 
a quest to rescue a friend from the horrific depths of 
the Abyss, or find yourself hoisting a tankard with the 
friendly giants of Ysgard. You might w alk on streets 
made of solid fire or test your mettle on a battlefield 
where the fallen are resurrected with each dawn.
T h e M a t e r ia l  P l a n e
The Material Plane is the nexus where the philosophical 
and elemental forces that define the other planes collide 
in the jum bled existence of mortal life and mundane 
matter. All the worlds of D&D exist within the Material 
Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns 
and adventures. The rest of the multiverse is defined in 
relation to the Material Plane.
The worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse, 
for they reflect the creative imagination of the DMs 
who set their gam es there, as well as the players w hose 
heroes adventure there. They include magic-wasted 
desert planets and island-dotted water worlds, worlds 
where magic com bines with advanced technology and 
others trapped in an endless Stone Age, worlds where 
the gods walk and places they have abandoned.
The best-known worlds in the multiverse are the 
ones that have been published as official campaign 
settings for the D&D game over the years—Greyhawk, 
Blackmoor, Dragonlance, the Forgotten Realms, 
Mystara, Birthright, Dark Sun, and Eberron, among 
others. Each of these worlds boasts its own cast of 
heroic adventurers and schem ing villains, its own 
ancient ruins and forgotten artifacts, its own dungeons 
and its own dragons. But if your campaign takes place 
on one of these worlds, it belongs to your DM—you 
might imagine it as one of thousands of parallel versions 
of the world, which might diverge wildly from the 
published version.
M a t e r i a l  E c h o e s
The Material Plane is a richly magical place, and its 
magical nature is reflected in the two planes that share 
its central place in the multiverse. The Feywild and the 
Shadowfell are parallel dim ensions occupying the same 
cosm ological space, so they are often called echo planes 
or mirror planes to the Material Plane. The w orlds and 
landscapes of these planes mirror the natural world 
of the Material Plane but reflect those features into 
different form s—m ore marvelous and magical in the 
Feywild, distorted and colorless in the Shadowfell. 
W here a volcano stands in the Material Plane, a 
mountain topped with skyscraper-sized crystals that 
glow  with internal fire towers in the Feywild, and a 
jagged rock outcropping resembling a skull marks the 
spot on the Shadowfell.
The Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie, is a land 
of soft lights and wonder, a country of little people with 
great desires, a place of music and death. It is a realm 
of eternal twilight, with slow  lanterns bobbing in the 
gentle breeze and huge fireflies buzzing through groves 
and fields. The sky is alight with the faded colors of 
the setting, or perhaps rising, sun. But, in fact, the sun 
never truly sets or rises; it remains stationary, dusky 
and low in the sky. Away from the settled areas ruled by 
the Seelie Court, the land is a tangle of sharp-toothed 
brambles and syrupy fens—perfect territory for the 
Unseelie to hunt their prey. Fey creatures, such as those 
brought to the world by conjure woodland beings and 
similar spells, dwell in the Feywild.
The Shadowfell, also called the Plane o f Shadow, is 
a darkly lighted dimension, a world of black and white 
where color has been leached from everything. It is a 
place of toxic darkness that hates the light, where the 
sky is a black vault with neither sun nor stars.
P o s i t i v e  a n d  N e g a t i v e  P l a n e s
Like a dome above the other planes, the Positive Plane is the 
source of radiant energy and the raw life force that suffuses 
all living beings, from the puny to the sublime. Its dark 
reflection is the Negative Plane, the source of necrotic energy 
that destroys the living and animates the undead.
B e y o n d  t h e  M a t e r ia l
Beyond the Material Plane, the various planes of 
existence are realm s of myth and mystery. They’re 
not simply other worlds, but different qualities of 
being, formed and governed by spiritual and elemental 
principles abstracted from the ordinary world.
P l a n a r  T r a v e l
W hen adventurers travel into other planes of existence, 
they are undertaking a legendary journey across the 
thresholds of existence to a mythic destination where 
they strive to complete their quest. Such a journey is the 
stuff of legend. Braving the realm s of the dead, seeking 
out the celestial servants of a deity, or bargaining with 
an efreeti in its hom e city will be the subject of song and 
story for years to com e.
Travel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be 
accom plished in two ways: by casting a spell or by using 
a planar portal.
Spells. A number of spells allow direct or indirect 
access to other planes of existence. Plane shift and 
gate can transport adventurers directly to any other 
plane of existence, with different degrees of precision. 
Etherealness allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal 
Plane and travel from there to any of the planes it 
touches—the Shadowfell, the Feywild, or the Elemental 
Planes. And the astral 
projection spell lets adventurers 
project themselves into the Astral Plane and travel to 
the Outer Planes.
Portals. A portal is a general term for a stationary 
interplanar connection that links a specific location 
on one plane to a specific location on another. Som e 
portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fog- 
shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it 
effects the interplanar travel. Others are locations— 
circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, 
or even whole towns—that exist in multiple planes at 
once or flicker from one plane to another in turn. Som e 
are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a 
very similar location on the Material Plane, such as the 
heart of a volcano (leading to the Plane o f Fire) or the 
depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water).
T r a n s i t i v e  P l a n e s
The Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called the 
Transitive Planes. They are mostly featureless realms 
that serve primarily as ways to travel from one plane 
to another. Spells such as etherealness and astral 
projection allow characters to enter these planes and 
traverse them to reach the planes beyond.
The Ethereal Plane is a misty, fog-bound dimension 
that is som etim es described as a great ocean. Its shores, 
called the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane 
and the Inner Planes, so that every location on those 
planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal 
Plane. Certain creatures can see into the Border 
Ethereal, and the see invisibility and true seeing spell 
grant that ability. Som e magical effects also extend from 
the Material Plane into the Border Ethereal, particularly 
effects that use force energy such as forcecage and wall
o f 
force. The depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are 
a region of swirling mists and colorful fogs.
The Astral Plane is the realm o f thought and dream, 
where visitors travel as disem bodied souls to reach 
the planes of the divine and dem onic. It is a great, 
silvery sea, the sam e above and below, with swirling 
w isps of white and gray streaking am ong motes of light 
resem bling distant stars. Erratic w hirlpools of color 
flicker in midair like spinning coins. Occasional bits of 
solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral 
Plane is an endless, open domain.
I n n e r  P l a n e s
The Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material 
Plane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental 
substance from  which all the w orlds were made. The 
four Elemental Planes—Air, Earth, Fire, and Water— 
form a ring around the Material Plane, suspended 
within the churning Elemental Chaos.
At their innermost edges, where they are closest 
to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal 
geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes 
resemble a world in the Material Plane. The four 
elements mingle together as they do in the Material 
Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. Farther from the 
Material Plane, though, the Elemental Planes are both 
alien and hostile. Here, the elements exist in their 
purest form—great expanses of solid earth, blazing fire, 
crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. These regions 
are little-known, so when discussing the Plane of Fire, 
for example, a speaker usually m eans just the border 
region. At the farthest extents of the Inner Planes, 
the pure elements dissolve and bleed together into an 
unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding 
substance, the Elemental Chaos.
O u t e r  P l a n e s
If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that 
makes up the multiverse, the Outer Planes are the 
direction, thought and purpose for such construction. 
Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as 
divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the 
Outer Planes are best known as the hom es of deities.
W hen discussing anything to do with deities, the 
language used must be highly metaphorical. Their 
actual hom es are not literally “places” at all, but 
exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realm s of 
thought and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one 
can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as 
a sort of border region, while extensive spiritual regions 
lie beyond ordinary sensory experience.
Even in those perceptible regions, appearances 
can be deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes 
appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the 
Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the 
whim s of the powerful forces that live on the Outer 
Planes. The desires of the mighty forces that dwell on 
these planes can remake them completely, effectively 
erasing and rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill 
their own needs.
Distance is a virtually m eaningless concept on the 
Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes 
often seem  quite small, but they can also stretch on to 
what seem s like infinity. It might be possible to take 
a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to 
the ninth, in a single day—if the powers of the Hells 
desire it. Or it could take weeks for travelers to make a 
grueling trek across a single layer.
The most well-known Outer Planes are a group of 
sixteen planes that correspond to the eight alignments 
(excluding neutrality) and the shades of distinction 
between them.

The planes with som e element of good in their nature 
are called the Upper Planes. Celestial creatures such 
as angels and pegasi dwell in the Upper Planes. Planes 
with som e element of evil are the Lower Planes. Fiends 
such as dem ons, devils, and yugoloths dwell in the 
Lower Planes. A plane’s alignment is its essence, and 
a character w hose alignment doesn’t match the plane’s 
experiences a profound sense of dissonance there.
W hen a good creature visits Elysium, for example, it 
feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature feels 
out o f tune and m ore than a little uncomfortable.
O t h e r  P l a n e s
Existing som ehow  between or beyond the known planes 
of existence are a variety of other realms.
S i g i l  a n d  t h e  O u t l a n d s
The Outlands is the plane between the Outer Planes, a 
plane of neutrality, but not the neutrality of nothingness. 
Instead it incorporates a little of everything, keeping it 
all in a paradoxical balance—simultaneously concordant 
and in opposition. It is a broad region of varied terrain, 
with open prairies, towering mountains, and twisting, 
shallow rivers, strongly resembling an ordinary world 
of the Material Plane.
The Outlands is circular, like a great w heel—in fact, 
those w ho envision the Outer Planes as a wheel point 
to the Outlands as proof, calling it a m icrocosm  of the
planes. That argument might be circular, however, 
for it is possible that the arrangement of the Outlands 
inspired the idea of the Great W heel in the first place.
Around the outside edge of the circle, evenly spaced, 
are the gate-towns: sixteen settlements, each built 
around a portal leading to one o f the Outer Planes. Each 
town shares many of the characteristics of the plane 
where its gate leads.
At the center of the Outlands, like the axle of the 
planar wheel, the Spire shoots im possibly high into the 
sky. Above this thin peak floats the ring-shaped city of 
Sigil, the City of Doors. This bustling planar m etropolis 
holds countless portals to other planes and worlds.
Sigil is a trader’s city. G oods, merchandise, and 
information com e to it from across the planes. There 
is a brisk trade in information about the planes, in 
particular in the com m and words or items required for 
the operation of particular portals. These portal keys 
are highly sought after, and many travelers within the 
city are looking for a particular portal or a portal key 
to allow them to continue on their way.
D e m i p l a n e s
Demiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with 
their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality that 
don’t seem  to fit anywhere else. Demiplanes com e 
into being by a variety o f means. Som e are created by 
spells, such as demiplane, or generated at the desire of a 
powerful deity or other force. They may exist naturally, 
as a fold o f existing reality that has been pinched off 
from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe 
growing in power. A  given demiplane can be entered 
through a single point where it touches another plane. 
Theoretically, a plane shift spell can also carry travelers 
to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required 
for the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire. The 
gate spell is m ore reliable, assum ing the caster knows 
of the demiplane.
T h e  Fa r  R e a l m
The Far Realm  is beyond the known multiverse. In fact, 
it might be an entirely separate multiverse with its own 
physical and magical laws. W here stray energies from 
the Far Realm  leak onto another plane, life and matter 
are warped and twisted into alien shapes that defy 
ordinary geometry and biology.
The entities that abide in the Far Realm  are too alien 
for a normal mind to accept without damage. Titanic 
creatures swim  through nothingness, preoccupied 
with m adness. Unspeakable things whisper awful 
truths to those w ho dare listen. For mortals, knowledge 
of the Far Realm  is a triumph of mind over the rude 
boundaries of matter, space, and eventually sanity.
There are no known portals to the Far Realm, or 
at least none that are still viable. Ancient elves once 
pierced the boundary of eons with a vast portal to the 
Far Realm  within a mountain called Firestorm Peak, 
but their civilization im ploded in bloody terror and 
the portal’s location—even its home world—is long- 
forgotten. Other portals might still exist, marked by the 
alien forces leaking through to corrupt the Material 
Plane around them.

NSPIRATION FOR ALL OF THE FANTASY 
WORK I HAVE
done stems directly from the love my father 
showed when I was a lad, for he spent many 
hours telling me stories he made up as he went 
along, tales o f 
cloaked old men who could grant 
wishes, of 
magic rings and enchanted swords, 
or wicked sorcerers and dauntless swordsmen. .
.. All of 
us tend to get ample helpings of 
fantasy 
when we are very 
young, from fairy tales such as those 
written by the Brothers Grimm and Andrew Lang.
This often leads to reading books of 
mythology, paging 
through bestiaries, and consultation of 
compilations 
of 
the myths of 
various lands and peoples. Upon such 
a base I built my interest in fantasy, being an avid 
reader of 
all science fiction and fantasy literature 
since 1950. The following authors were of 
particular 
inspiration to me.
